## Installation
1. We recommend a Python 3.8 interpreter (in our experience spaCy and CUDA have issues with 3.10). Your mileage with other
interpreter versions may vary.
2. Create a python virtual environment either [manually](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/) or through your IDE.
3. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
