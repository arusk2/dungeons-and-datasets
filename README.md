An NLP dataset for creating rooms for use in World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game. This alpha release has 2,000 examples of 
location/room descriptions sourced from handpicked PDF adventures, random generators, and a processed version of the 
[Critical Role dataset](https://github.com/RevanthRameshkumar/CRD3).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the release package. In order to clone the spaCy processed CRD3 dataset, you must
have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.
2. We recommend a Python 3.8 interpreter (in our experience spaCy and CUDA have issues with 3.10). Your mileage with other
interpreter versions may vary.
3. Create a python virtual environment either [manually](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/) or through your IDE.
4. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Packages
1. Choose a package release version.
