This door into the tower is on the leeward side of the structure.

You can see a large set of double doors almost dead center of the front facade.
"At one time, there also seems to have been several windows looking out at the forest path, but they are all currently bricked-up."
The remains of a smashed and weather beaten carriage sits in the middle of the path exactly where it ends and there is overgrown grass and plant life to either side of the building more than six feet tall.
"The double front doors are made out of mahogany with intricate carving patterns and impressive iron locks, all of which still appear in good condition."
There is also a pulley near the doors connected to a copper bell used to announce visitors.
"Peering into the thick fog hanging about, you recognize the outline of a vegetable garden in the back yard of the mansion."
It looks to be terribly overgrown but you can still make out several kinds of vegetables now growing wild.
"There is an old and weathered wooden sign that has been staked into the ground which reads, No Trespassers! The mansion has a single backdoor."
"As you enter through the creaky yet solid front doors, the smell of musty and moldy air hits your noses."
There is also a chill in the air that makes you shiver.
Immediately to the west is a closed door that does not appear to be locked.
To the east is a second door as well as a set of stairs going up to the second floor.
The stairs are horribly rotten and do not look very safe.
"Up ahead there is a long hallway with five doors; two on the east wall, two on the west wall, and one at the very end."
Five feet inside the front doors and directly overhead is a huge brass chandelier that holds six glass lanterns on its arms.
"Opening the door, you see several pieces of furniture."
This appears to be a waiting room for visitors.
"There are two wooden chairs with brown leather seats, a side table with an ashtray, a sitting couch that is brown with red trim, and a knee-high table."
There is a cross stitch hanging on the wall that reads Welcome To Our Home.
"Entering into this room, you instantly feel even colder."
This appears to be the VonGlauss Dining Hall and at every seat around the eight person table sits a ghostly apparition.
They are all talking and laughing as if they are not out of place at all.
"In the north-west corner of the room is a banquet table filled with plates, cups, and cutlery."
This room contains two very long serving tables filled with mountains of food.
"However, all does not seem right as the food does not give off any smell or any steam."
When you open the door to this room you see a sitting parlor.
"There are two large brown leather arm chairs, a brown leather couch, and an impressive looking harpsichord in the south-western corner."
Peering into this room you discover another parlor.
There is a long table covered in a white tablecloth along the same wall as the door and it has a book on top.
"There is also a wingback chair, another leather couch, a daybed, and a round wooden table in the north-east corner."
Sitting on top of the round table is a glass bottle which appears empty.
A quick glance at this room reveals it as the kitchen.
"There are two doors on the south wall, one on the north, and one on the east."
There are also a set of stairs leading up to the second floor.
"Additionally, there is a cutting table, an iron wash stand, and a brick oven."
Two of your senses are immediately stimulated as soon as you open this door.
The first is smell as this room has a horrible stench to it.
"It smells of rotting meat, pickles, and mold."
The second is hearing as you can easily make out the sound of a woman crying from somewhere deeper into the room.
The room itself appears to be a pantry.
"There are two rows of dual-sided shelves that go from the floor to the ceiling, as well as a few barrels and boxes strewn about."
A quick search of the room will reveal another ghost.
This room has been decorated for a child.
"There are many animals painted on the walls as well as a crib in the south-east corner, a chest of drawers on the west wall, and a toy box just to the west of the door."
"However, a moment of silence brings a tiny sound to your ears."
It sounds like someone breathing.
"Ascending the stairs, you reach the second floor hallway."
It spans the length of the Mansion in an E pattern.
"The northern arm has a set of stairs heading down to the first floor, a door on the north wall and a door at the end of the hall facing east."
"The middle arm has four doors, two on the south wall and two on the north."
"The southern arm contains only the rotten stairs; however, along the western wall, there are six paintings hung in the hallway."
Each of these paintings is a portrait of a previous matron or patron of the VonGlauss family.
"Interestingly, there seems to have once hung a seventh painting at the northern end of the hallway, but it has been removed to leave behind a noticeable rectangular void."
This room has been decorated for a child.
"There are many animals painted on the walls as well as a crib in the south-east corner, a chest of drawers on the west wall, and a toy box just to the west of the door."
"However, a moment of silence brings a tiny sound to your ears."
It sounds like someone breathing.
"As you open this door, you are met with a guest bedroom."
"There is a large four-post canopy bed to the west, a chest of drawers to the east, and a full-body mirror on the south wall."
Within moments of opening the door you recognize this place as the library.
This 20x30 room is lined on every wall with floor to ceiling bookshelves and every shelf is crammed with volumes.
There must be more than two thousand books in total.
In the center of the room sits a mahogany table with a single wooden chair.
Upon this table lay an iron lockbox.
"This storage area is filled with brooms, mops, buckets, rags, dusters, and rug beaters."
"Also, up on the highest shelf, you notice four glass bottles marked wood polish."
"This closet is filled with blankets, sheets, comforters, pillows, throws, and quilts."
You open this door to discover the Master Bedroom.
There is one door on the north wall as well as a huge bed near the east wall.
A chest of drawers sits just along the west wall and there is an old rocking chair in the north-east corner.
"Finally, along the north wall is the only window in the mansion that has not been bricked up."
It is a beautiful stained glass window that depicts the VonGlauss family crest of two cranes on a shield of blue with a silver sword down the middle.
Opening the chest of drawers triggers a spell that blasts open the stained glass window and allows three Gargoyles to enter the room.
"Stepping into this room, you get the impression that it was a lady's dressing room."
There is floral patterned wall paper and the whole room smells faintly of perfume.
There is a single door in the north east corner of the room.
"Additionally, there is a makeup desk with a wooden chair along the west wall, a full length mirror on the north wall, and a dozen dresses are hung on hooks adoring the east wall."
The last thing that your eyes settle upon is a pine wood hatch in the ceiling that appears to open up to an attic.
Opening the door you are greeted with a frightening sight!.
Sitting inside a large iron bathtub is the ghost of a naked woman.
She is currently holding a knife to her throat and she yells at you to leave her alone.
The clothing and the mirror have nothing special about them.
The north-east door leads to a small indoor commode.
"Lifting yourself up into the attic, you look around to see a mostly empty and dusty room."
"There is a large black sheet hanging from the west wall, an old table that is cracked and split, and a roughly cut wooden ladder that looks as though it can fit into the hatchway."
As you open the door your eyes instantly see two long tables in the center of the room.
"Both of these are filled with bottles, beakers, tubes, papers, ink jars, and quills."
You also notice a large bookshelf along the west wall which is mostly empty and looks like it was cleaned out in a hurry.
Immediately to the west of the door sits an iron chest with a large padlock on the front.
There is also a huge box in the south-east corner of the room.
It has a five-by-five foot base and is ten foot tall.
It appears to have been nailed shut by someone using three times more nails than necessary.
"Finally, you notice that a single book has been left behind and it rests on the floor within a foot of the doorway."
This room is very dark and musty.
"It appears to be a huge L shaped storage area filled with boxes, crates, old and damaged furniture, barrels, and two large piles of items covered with white canvas sheets."
There is also a door on the south wall.
"While you are in this underground room, a sudden rumbling grabs your attention, and the room shakes as an intense earthquake hits the city."
People in the room start making their way out to see what is happening.
"Despite the room having only small shaded windows, the light outside seems to glow purple."
"A few moments later, desperate yelling and screams for help can be heard from above, and once again the ground shakes, causing the tavern above you to collapse upon itself."
"As you emerge from the basement into a courtyard filled with the debris of the fallen tavern and surrounded by a dust cloud (you cant see more than a few dozen feet in front of you), you begin to hear moaning in the back of your mind."
This quickly becomes a scream.
"Madness grips you, and for a moment you can feel your sanity slipping away."
Entrails are strung up around the gate - a grim decoration that confirms the fate of the priests.
The temples open-air worshiping area is horribly desecrated.
Dark smoke rises from around a burning pyre of furniture and temple items.
"A towering canine brute picks up an excrement-covered glaive from the ground beside the fire, and two shadows seem to stir from within the fire."
"This crumbled building has been burned, smashed, and had its walls desecrated with gnoll bodily fluids."
Bits of wooden bunk beds are still smoking around.
This round tower has a small slit that allows those inside to watch and shoot enemies on the outer side of the temple.
A round red carpet with strange symbols lies beneath your feet.
"In the walls around the device, a finely painted pictograph depicts some familiar events."
"The three-story tower looms in the center of the square, equidistant from all surround buildings."
"The sides of the tower are decorated with the colors and symbols of each family, continuously interweaving and mixing."
This is the only place you've seen so far where these symbols intermingle in such a way.
The heavy and ornamented wooden door has an inscription in draconic.
The aura of oppression that emanates from within the gray and bleak tower is palpable.
"The tall tower, with no windows and a single wooden door, looms menacingly over you, and you feel like you're being watched by some invisible entity."
"Behind the barred gates you see small cells, barely big enough for a human adult to lie in."
"Most of the buildings are of simple construction, with clean white walls and clay shingles reflecting the many magical red lights floating around."
"Occasionally, you see a wider and taller building, with no doors, and pleasant squared sitting areas on its ground floor."
"These temples have large golden bells on their ivory towers, and young acolytes bow to you as you pass."
"The quartz buildings are often streaked with blue veins, intermingling together to create an impressive pattern that seems to effortlessly flow from one building to another."
"Tall and sturdy looking, these homes look big enough to contains multiple families."
Calm instrumental music can be heard coming from no specific direction.
"The large white stone doors are closed, and the stationed guards observe you as you approach."
The door seems to open effortlessly as a small and finely dressed female lizardfolk walks out.
The dark iron and obsidian buildings appear to dim the twilight.
"Cold and menacing, even your echoing footsteps on the green-tinted stone roads seem to warrant unwanted attention."
"Window shutters are closed as you approach, and groups of lizardfolk actively face and move away from you."
Armed guards cross your way multiple times and at least one group at a time seems to trail you from street to street.
"After you climb in through the trapdoor, you reach an empty 15x15ft room, with four doors, one on each wall."
"After you climb in through the trapdoor, you reach the center of a 50x10ft corridor."
"On one end lies a statue of a hooded figure, and on the other, a massive stone face is carved on the wall."
"On the base of the hooded statue, a gold plaque at its base with an inscription reads When the sun sets in the East, And the Evil comes from the North, The only things opposing them are the Moon and the Saviour."
"You stand in a 15x15ft room, and in front of you, an archway leads to a very similar room, with a closed door at its end."
A big gold pushable button is on the wall to the right.
"Behind you, a small inscription above the archway reads ""To advance, you must enter once but leave twice""."
"Below it are two small illusory numbers, a one and a zero."
"You reach 25x10ft room with two large pods, big enough to hold a tall humanoid."
A closed door lies between both pods.
"You reach a 10x10ft square room with a closed door on the opposite wall, and a large silver key on the ground at its center."
You reach a 25x15ft room with a closed door on the opposite wall.
"Above it, a large dark inscription reads: The key exists inside your veins, use the key to paint me red, but be aware of what you spurn, for what was taken shall be returned."
"You enter a 25x15ft room with two large glass chambers side by side, filled with a greenish glowing transparent liquid."
"A console with a single lever is in the middle of the glass vats, and each vat has a big red button with a skull on it."
"This circular 10ft radius room has a large closed wooden chest at its center, and a closed door on the opposite wall."
"Hundreds of animated keys are flying above you, perpetually moving in circular fashion around the room."
"The square room you're on has a very high ceiling, 40ft above you, with a trapdoor on it, and no other doors."
"As you stand at the center of the room, the ground beneath you starts moving, splitting into four."
"Each of the platforms starts moving into the wall, revealing a deep 30ft pit with sharp spears at the bottom."
"You climb through the trapdoor, and stand at the top a 50x5 straight staircase with a low ceiling."
"As you start moving down, you see something at the bottom, a floating round creature with a single cyclopean eye, and many tentacles with smaller eyes at their end."
"You reach a large circular 30ft radius room, with dozens of doors distributed evenly along the walls."
"As you move inside the room, the doors open all at once and zombies rush from half of them, into the room."
"This circular 15ft radius room has a closed door on its opposite side, a circular pit with magical darkness obscuring what is beneath it, and a large corridor around the pit, providing access to the door."
"A large wooden pole stands at the center of the room, rising from the pit and nearly reaching the ceiling."
You reach a large 15x15ft room with a statue on each corner of the room and a door on the opposite wall.
"Two statues are made of the same mineral as the pyramid, representing the sun and the moon."
"The other two represent dragons, one made of silver, and another made of a green metal."
"The floor has a drawn compass on it, with a big arrow pointing northwards."
"This 10x10ft room has a single altar at its center with an inscription reading ""Create that which is so fragile, to utter its name would break it""."
You see another gigantic human face carved on the opposite wall.
"Above it, a small golden plaque reads ""The word is monkey""."
"This small 10x10ft room has a closed door on the opposite wall, a carved dragons head opening its jaw, and a small plaque on the left wall with an inscription reading ""Some beasts bite the hand that feeds""."
The button to unlock the door is inside the dragons mouth.
"It can only be pressed by a living humanoid, appearing illusory to objects or other creatures."
"The dragons head is an inanimate statue, and wont bite anyone, since dragons are not beasts."
Pushing the button unlocks the door with an audible click.
"You find yourselves at the end of a very long 100x10ft corridor, with a closed door on the opposite end."
This sentient door talks politely with the characters.
"It vanishes if the characters find a way for it to say the word ""monkey"", revealing an unlock door behind it."
"It is difficult to intimidate this door, as it is invulnerable."
"It knows it will temporarily vanish if it says ""monkey"", so players need creative methods."
"This small 10x10ft room has a small golden button on a panel at its center, with an illusory number floating above it, and a closed door on the opposite wall."
"Once you enter the room, the number starts counting the seconds down from ten."
Pressing the button resets the countdown from ten seconds.
"This large circular 15ft radius room has a closed door on the opposite side, and a paper scroll floats in the center of the room, with a bright light shining above it."
This small square room has no more doors.
"It contains a console filled with buttons and lever, very similar to the ones found in the other temples."
This is the end of the dungeon.
"Around the room, there are many tables, alchemy apparatuses, ancient tomes, notes, and other dark magic paraphernalia."
"Hanging by chains in the walls, there are several corpses of elves and dwarfs."
"Floating on the center of the room, and facing the characters, is a Demilich."
"The gate leads into a winding 5ft wide tunnel which, after many twists and turns, leads into an underground laboratory."
"There are several large acid vials, glowing green, lined up in one of the walls of the laboratory."
"Giant cooking pots stand over campfires, boiling and creating more acid."
The room is filled with noxious fumes.
This 50ft radius circular room has hundreds of eggs neatly protected in thick spider webs.
"Large copper tubes spread throughout the room, covering most surfaces."
"Four large acid vats stand on each corner of the room, connected to a giant 30ft wide pump in the center."
"The room itself is octagonal, 60ft wide, and brightly lit."
"There are many alchemical tools around (most of which have been corroded beyond use), and a very wide and varied amount of vials spread through the room, mostly containing different kinds of acids and poisons."
It looks like no one has walked down those steps in many years.
"The staircase eventually descends into a cold and dark 30ft radius circular room, with white ivory pillars around its walls."
"Behind the center painting in the back wall of the laboratory, under the balcony, there is a red rune, created by the Fraz-Urb’luu."
"A large dining table lays before you, plates and silverware lying upon it, with a slight green taint."
"A large silver tureen is found at the center of the table, with barnacles growing on it."
This cramped broom closet is covered in cobwebs.
Seems like nothing has entered here in a long time.
"The buzzing of insects is heard as soon as the door opens, and the foul stench hits you immediately afterwards."
"Jars, cans, and other containers of what once was fresh food, are now covered with insects, and contain nothing but spoiled leftovers."
The doors to both these rooms are slightly open.
"As you open the first one, you see a table and a set of chairs in somewhat decent condition."
The broken window in the room allows some of the mist to slowly float inside and disperse.
"As you push the door open, you see a very similar room to the one before."
A sheet of parchment and some writing material now lie on top of the table.
"As you approach the slightly open door, a creepy piano tune is heard from within the room."
The volume slowly grows louder and louder.
"Another relaxation room, once more mist is drifting from the broken windows to the inside of the room."
The rotten smell of wood is stronger here.
"A rhythmic beat is heard from within the room, as well as the occasional grunt."
Within the closed door lies a small room with a smelly moist bed.
This small office is illuminated by a single candle on the table.
Next to it lies an open book.
"Once you open, it slams open and a large quantity of water hits you: the room was completely flooded."
What used to be cabinets filled with medicinal plants and healing items now carries a foul stench.
"The plants are dead and useless, and the potions turned into black sludge."
A small corridor leads you to three rooms.
"The first two contain bunk beds, now falling apart, where the crew members once slept."
"The third reveals several sleeping nets, and snoring sounds are heard from their occupants: humanoid monsters, similar to the ones that attacked you on the deck."
The very air you’re breathing in this room is a poisoned fume.
A slowly pulsing deep sound is heard from darkness within.
"A very obvious evil intent washes over you, and you feel that you’re being watched."
The sound is coming from a large abomination in the center of the room.
"This dark green mass spreads around the ships mast, and infiltrates into the ships wooden structure."
"Every second, it pulses, almost like a heartbeat."
"The smell of hay is strong here, as is the smell of fur and animals."
"The room has resisted the constant humidity, and is in fact warm, possibly due to the four hellish dogs that are currently sleeping in it."
"Another cargo room, filled to the brink with crates, barrels, and containers."
"Some of the crates are open, and all carried organic material, which has long rotted away."
"Before opening the doors, you notice muffled sounds coming from within."
"It seems like two people are arguing at one another, one in each room."
"A set of large glowing mushrooms which will explode when disturbs them (the path is riddled with them, so unless the characters actively avoid them, they will be disturbed)."
Each mushroom creates a DC 19 Fireball when disturbed (explosions won’t trigger other mushrooms).
The ground has 6 small gold bricks lightly buried there.
The first brick to be touched causes a DC 19 Lightning Bolt to erupt towards who picked it up.
Each brick is worth 100gp.
The casino is a grandiose building.
"Outside the entrance, dozens of Dancing Lights float around, smooth jazz is heard (played by a band of female half-elves inside the casino), and four Ogres in suits guarding the heavy-looking iron and dragonglass doors."
"Inside, red carpets, crystal chandeliers, and constantly served food and drinks create a magical atmosphere, and the rooms are filled with people of all ages and races, playing games."
"Vines cling to its steps, up its very high walls."
"This courtyard, surrounded by a rusty and mostly broken down iron spike fence, is clearly the remains of an ancient prison."
Rotten and decaying humanoid corpses fill the cell’s floor.
Some parts of the tunnel have slightly collapsed over the centuries.
"Passage is still possible, but large clusters of rock and debris make passage difficult."
"This large square area is a mostly-flat bit of desert, with seemingly random holes across it."
"The tunnel is excellently constructed, clearly a creation of dwarfish masonry, and leftovers of rail tracks are seen along it."
These massively overgrown parks were once properly cleaned and taken care of.
"Now, only wild nature, boosted by the magical powers and auras left behind, is found."
"Huge trees and bushes hide a variety of dangerous jungle beasts, as well as the occasional Treant."
"Glistening bath houses, spas, thermal pools, aquariums, children’s slides, artificial lakes, and other water-based relaxation activities are concentrated in this area."
A magnificent coliseum looms over the surrounding buildings.
"White, pristine, with sharp edges, this imposing construction commands respect from all those who pass its gates."
"Inside it, a large sand arena is surrounded by a 1-ft wall, around which are rows and rows of seats for spectators."
"Two large areas stand, opposite to one another across the arena, for important guests, such as high ranking officials, the Emperor, or rich merchants."
"Within the vessel, there is no gravity, and characters can float around (although they can only choose their direction when in contact with a surface)."
The bottom of this section of the ship is exceptionally bright.
"The ceiling, merely 30ft high, is in fact a Wall of Light created by a Devourer lurking in this section, and currently above the fake light-ceiling."
"This room is cylindrical, 50ft tall, and with a 40ft diameter."
"Around the walls are 10 very large mirrors (these are actually part of the walls, and it seems like the walls gradually turn from their black opaque metal into the mirror) and a large archway (20ft wide and 30ft tall, with a black cloak covering the other side)."
The characters enter a misty dark room which seems to have no limits.
The only exit is the entrance through which the characters entered it.
"Floating directly above them, is a gargantuan Elder Brain, a physical manifestation of the leader of the Kalashticons that led that ship here."
"You appear on the corner of a large square room, illuminated by torches and a floating light."
"The walls, well-painted and finely built, indicate you might be inside a noble’s manor."
"There are two exits out of the room, both closed with wooden interior doors, and a large round table lies in the center of the room."
Sitting at the table are eight people.
"Lone and desolate, this eerie construction is avoided by beasts and other wildlife in the area."
"At its center, there is a downwards spiraling staircase, leading into the darkness, and wide enough for two people to walk side by side."
"This gate reads ""The Plague Zone"" in Primordial."
"The corpses nearby show signs of putrefaction and rotting, as if they have been dead for a lot longer than the others."
"It leads into a 40ft wide square crypt, under a permanent Darkness spell."
"The crypt is eerily silent, and the door closes behind the characters without making any noise."
There are six medium-sized sarcophagus and a large-sized one in the center of the room.
A mahogany door lies opposite to the steel entrance door.
"The crypt leads into an underground very large cave, with a rough 1-mile wide circular shape."
Vegetation grows in the dirt and rock ground (mostly mushrooms or other plants that grow in the dark).
"There are hundreds of gravestones randomly placed in this cave, and there is no obvious path through them."
"The silver door leads into a narrow corridor, which then leads into a brightly lit room."
"The 100ft-side cube has a 30ft high tower near each corner, containing a door on the floor level, an internal spiraling staircase, and a trapdoor at its top."
Atop each tower is a floating fist-sized crystal.
"The building is heavily guarded at all times, with high-ranking officers and prestige recruits there at all times."
"The gray towering walls intimidate anyone passing through the gate, and the building is as imposing as it is a source of pride for residents of the neighborhood, who can boast of living in the safest area of the city."
"On the opposite side of the bunker’s entrance, a small 10ft wide safe-room protected by magical adamantine doors acts as a final safety measure, where the royal family can barricade themselves in."
"To the west, the Dining Hall, where a large party is held day and night, without stopping."
"Where a massive dining table once stood, now hundreds of undead dance in rotten formal garments to the sound of cheery jazz music."
"To the east, the Servant’s Quarters."
This includes the Kitchen and the Guard Room.
"The kitchen has a few Zombies there dressed in servant’s outfits, and one is wearing a chef’s hat."
"To the north, the Main Hall, which spans across both floors."
"It is under an indoors permanent Control Weather spell, making the temperature within the room arctic cold."
The walls are covered in arcane runes and magic circles.
The western laboratory is Ur’s Arcane Research laboratory.
"Thousands of books line the walls, with large tables and magical apparatuses spread across the center of the room."
"Several Dancing Lights fly and dance across the room, providing light on whatever anyone in the room is looking at."
"Floating astrolabes, globes, quills, books, and gems also slowly hover around the room in a clock-wise motion."
The eastern laboratory is Reaper’s mortuary.
"Several iron tables are lined against the back wall, with humanoid cadavers lying on them."
"The corpses are cut open, stitched together, dismembered, bitten into, or otherwise experimented upon."
The center of the room contains several steel apparatuses that resemble construct arms with sharp finesse tools at their end.
The southwest spire is Ur’s chambers.
"It contains a pocket dimension somewhat bigger than the actual spire, mimicking the effects of a Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion."
"All the furniture looks expensive, and scantily clad women serve visitors with fresh fruit and delicious wines."
"One of the rooms is magically locked (requiring Ur’s blood to open), and contains dozens of magical artifacts that Ur has collected over the decades."
"With modest furniture, the small tower has a washroom and a humble bedroom."
"In the canopy bed, there is a corpse of a woman wearing a pink dress."
The northwest spire is the astronomy lab.
"The ceiling is see-through from within, and an enormous telescope pointing at the stars allows one to magically bypass the storm clouds and gaze at the distant universe."
The room is round and roughly forty feet in diameter.
Right down the center of it are five hanging buckets.
The ropes holding them extend directly into the ceiling where they meld into the stone.
There is a door on the far side of the room with no discernible handle.
"You can make out a small inscription in the stone near the door, but will need to get closer to see what it says."
A wooden sign is planted firmly in the ground in front of the buckets with bold text carefully written upon it.
You also see a small pile of skeletons about fifteen feet to the left of the door.
They are armored and some of them hold weapons in their hands.
One of them is lying on his back with arms still bound.
A few feet to the left is another corpse that clearly belongs to a dwarf.
It holds a pickax in its hand and the floor near the body is partially destroyed.
Just to the right of the door is a skeleton clutching at what was once his heart with one hand.
The other hand is laying on top of a strange wooden chest and is tightly grasping something you can’t make out from this distance.
Further right is a set of clay pots with some silver scattered on the floor in front of them.
Just beyond the pots is a basin made of smoothed stone.
The room is lit with electric torches and just behind the family is a switch with a lever beneath it that reads: Start Simulation.
When the lever is flipped the golem will spring to life and begin walking straight towards the dwarven family who throw their hands in the air and scream through a small speaker.
A projector kicks on and shows the image of a dragon on the ceiling that circles the dwarves.
There is another doorway off to the side that reads Observation Chambers.
This is simply a narrow hallway that spans the entire edge of the room and allows vision of all of the obstacles without risk of being harmed.
The room has two shelves that are covered from floor to ceiling in wine bottles.
There is a closed door on the opposite side of the room.
There are a few baskets overflowing with grapes and a table in the center of the room surrounded by six chairs.
On top of one of these desks are the tools needed to bottle wine.
The door at the top of the stairs is not locked and will open with ease once the trap has been triggered.
On the other side of the door is the interior of Jonathan's house.
On the wall next to the door they see a small lever behind a flower pot that is flipped up.
"Off to the sides of these corridors are rooms filled primarily with rotting beds, ancient shrines, and long forgotten relics."
It is roughly a hundred and fifty feet across on the front side and adorned with many other snake carvings.
"The side of the temple is just over three hundred feet long, but its entrances are far more subtle than the main entrance."
In this room looms a man-like figure huddling over a large basin on the far side of the chamber.
Tables cover this room and nearly all of them are cluttered with vials containing a strange yellow liquid.
Some of them are cloudy while others are clear.
Some include a shade of green while others have a hint of red.
Dozens and dozens of snake skins scattered around the room.
"Some stored in chests, some decorating the walls, etc."
Room with prisons cells with very thin bars.
Inside one of these is a moderately sized boar and in another are six rabbits.
Every few doors is a room that has decayed pillows on the floor.
On the far end of the room is a giant snake carved into the wall.
"In some, this snake is devouring the world itself, in others a massive snake emerging from the earth, and in others still a snake eating its own tail."
One of these snakes has an emerald eye that has not been scavenged.
"One of the rooms the players walk into has a intricate rug on the floor completely covered in various snake designs, all different colors slithering together to create massive maze."
The room has some clay pots scattered around and a chest sitting on the far side of the rug that is beautifully colored with wooden snakes carved into the edges.
One room is filled with intricate jars and ceramic pots.
"They are beautifully painted, though this has faded a bit with time."
"Some contain copper coins, some contain crushed grains, but one contains a small snake that strikes out at the creature that opens it up."
Off of the study is a bedroom and this is where things get strange.
There is a large dresser with a mirror atop it as well as a comb crafted from rib cage.
"The entire room is decorated with skulls, all with their bottom jaws removed."
The key opens the trap door and when the party moves to descend the smell of blood immediately fills the room.
The ceiling is twelve feet tall and the room itself is roughly 40x40 ft.
"Piles of broken bones lay scattered around the edges of the room, nearly three feet in height in some places."
In the center of the room is a metal coffin.
In the center of the room is a makeshift stone sculpture of the Gol’Goroth.
"It is not well crafted, but the emotion that the artist was attempting to capture is clear - madness."
The most notable part of this statue is two massive jet gemstones in the eye sockets for the sculpture.
"If the party is brave enough to take these gems, the squirrels will all turn to look at that person, but they will not attack."
"The air turns foul, the room seems to darken, and violent tendencies arise."
On the far side of the room is an exit roughly five feet wide and eight feet high.
"Immediately after they enter this tunnel, there is a solid iron door to the left and a path that disappears around the corner to the right."
There is also a broom propped in the corner and scraps of cloth scattered around the room.
"If they continue to the edge of the platform, they see a twenty-foot drop into darkness."
"Corpses of animals and human lay scattered across the floor of the room, making patches of it into difficult terrain."
There is a small room with a table in the center stacked with samples of the Primordial Ooze.
"Amongst this are other gruesome science experiment results such as the corpses of creatures that the cultists attempted to splice, a few dead albino squirrels, and categorized skeletal remains."
"Luckily, a tunnel extends to another room a bit further back."
"In the second room, there are four Potions of Healing, a magical wand amongst a stack of ordinary armor and weapons, and a stash of wealth."
The floor above quickly slides back into place and leaves them in darkness as the laughter of the priest rings throughout the room.
The statue on the far side of the room begins to rise.
Attached to this room is another that appears to be living quarters for the priests.
There is a strong stench of many years of neglect.
In the center is a large sculpture of a scale made of white marble.
It sits upon a thirty foot wide seal on the ground that is decorated with a variety of runes.
The room is lit by a series of magically enchanted torches that don’t seem to risk burning out any time soon.
The room is also filled with the smell of incense that is burning at a few stations around this place of prayer.
On the other side is a tunnel that extends forty feet before opening up to a medium sized room.
This room is directly below the statue and the emblem on the floor.
"From the hall, the players can make out a massive iron structure."
"It is impossible to tell what it is until the players get closer, but the room is illuminated by torchlight."
It is roughly 40x40 and holds a 10ft tall iron golem in the center.
Off to the side of the room is a cache of potions that are the same color as potions of healing but are in fact poison.
A bit further down the hall is a finely carved stone door.
This one seems to be of incredible quality and has a detailed Gith warrior carved upon it.
The eyes of this Gith carving glow brightly and appear to be crafted from amber.
There does not appear to be any handles on this door.
There are two other Githyanki warriors in the room wearing fine armor laced with gold and short swords at their sides.
"The room is fairly small (roughly 6x6 squares with a 2x2 table near the back), so there is not a lot of room for maneuverability."
The door to this room is made of fairly thick stone.
It is different than most of the other doors they have encountered thus far which were simply made of wood.
"Regardless, it still opens without a huge amount of effort and reveals a rather small room."
"When the players enter this room, they see simply a desk with a skull sitting on the center of it."
"On the sides of the room are a few weapon racks with spears, swords, and maces upon them."
There are a few unlit torches sitting in sconces around the room as well.
"The center of the floor has a large, finely woven rug upon it."
The room itself is roughly 25ft x 25 ft.
"When the players get far enough in the room to step on the rug or modify it in any way, the skull upon the desk will burst into flame and a laugh will ring throughout the room as it slowly floats up into the air."
There is a large glowing orb at the center of this room - roughly 4 feet in diameter.
Inside is what appears to be a small lightning storm with a black shadow dancing and darting through storm clouds.
There are many signs posted around that say things such as WARNING! or DANGER! and have a skull and crossbones painted upon them.
Attached to the base of this orb are hundreds of cables that disappear into the floor.
There is a set of double doors on the far side of the room with a sign overhead that reads: Mineral Workshop.
"If the players look around, they can see small cables feeding into the lights of this room."
A small set of cords hang off of pylons on either side of the room with a small bit of metal at their end.
On the left is a strange canvas wall and another canvas wall on the far side of the room near the door to the workshop.
There is a strip in between these two that forms a makeshift hallway.
Down this hallway are two massive structures made of metal.
"They are round, but appear to be formed from curved blades that connect to a central post (they are fans)."
This large room is full of rocks of various shapes and sizes.
"They line the tables, some with labels and some without, some dull and ordinary while others are as bright and shining as gemstones."
"There are chisels, hand-cranked drills, magnifying lenses, and vials at each mineral station."
"The stations are labeled: Adamantine, Mithril, Cold Iron, Alchemical Silver, and Echoing Iron."
The room will be filled with a gas that is meant to decontaminate all of the minerals in the room and the door slams shut violently.
"This supply room is filled with basic ores: copper, iron, coal, various types of rocks, and a few gemstones of each type."
"The boxes fill most of the space, but the party can manage to fit inside."
"Mostly there is just small tools, scrap metal, workbenches, pipes, conveyor belts, and other crafting items scattered all across this large room."
"Wires hang in large piles, partially rusted from years of neglect."
A few stones still rest upon the conveyor belts that lead to large metal boxes.
Off to the side of the room is a large switch that is in a down position.
An automatic slicing machine in the back of the room springs to life and swings down onto the conveyor belt while another machine crushes down on the conveyor with large hammers.
"A slot in the wall opens to reveal a set of four glowing orbs: Orange, Purple, Green, and White."
"Next to a door on the far side of the room, a strange green and blue glyph begins to glow on the wall with a small spherical recess in its center."
In the center of the room are three large vats that appear to be feeding the bubbly liquid into the tubes that scatter around the room.
This room is full of dusty boxes and broken equipment.
"Most of it is rusted away from many centuries of neglect, but there are a few chests in the back of the room that still seem to be relatively intact."
Inside of these is an adamantine morningstar and an adamantine battleaxe.
This room is filled with unpowered clockwork creatures.
Some of them are half taken apart with frayed wires exposed while others seem to be fully constructed.
These completed entities stand eerily still and stare blankly.
There are a few blackboards in this room with complex equations and designs.
This large room is lined wall-to-wall with books.
"Most of them are tarnished and worn beyond recognition, but there are a few that are still in decent shape."
"An ironwork dragon head made of gears, metal, and wires rests near where a door handle would normally be."
The teeth appear razor sharp and each of them is tipped with a small ruby that makes them appear bloodied.
"This room contains a large bed, more books piled up, and some other half finished constructs."
There are also a few schematics mounted on the wall in portraits and some other odds and ends found in any bedroom.
"The room is small, but not without value."
There is a brick of solid gold sitting on a stand worth an easy 500 gold and a finely carved dagger sitting next to it that is decorated with small gemstones worth another 250 gold.
The prize gem of this room is on the podium in the center.
"A black bag, perhaps two feet long, held closed by a long piece of rope woven around the top."
"Upon this bag are velvet pictures of each color of dragon, firing their breath weapons into the skies."
"Two of the frog statues are immediately adjacent to an opening on the far side of the room, while the other two are on the far left and right."
On the far side of the room is a small stairway that leads up to narrow tunnel.
This one is full of small boulders scattered all across the room but there is a doorway on the far side that is closed.
"It has a large pool of water in the center, but it too is full of these medium sized boulders."
"As the party reaches the center of the room, they will be ambushed by a rock crab swarm."
"When they emerge, they find themselves in rather small room that is dominated by a perfectly round hole in the center."
This hole is filled with water that goes down until it disappears completely into darkness.
It is at least a hundred feet deep.
Written along the wall is a set of ancient text in the Deep Speech.
A single mindflayer sits on a throne of coral at the back side of the room.
There is a large door before them depicting a massive mural of a Kraken.
"When they press open the door, they will find themselves in a rather small room."
There is clearly powerful magics at play here.
In the very center of the room is an orb roughly a foot in diameter sitting atop a pedestal and locked tightly in place by a set of metal teeth.
Along the walls of this large dome-shaped area are words carved deep in the stone that glow a faint blue.
It is a simple door and it is set flawlessly within the stone with not a mote of dust visible.
"There is no handle on this door, but it opens without resistance when pressed."
On the other side is a corridor of darkness with walls and ceiling made of stone.
At the threshold of the doorway is a large brass ring that would be fixed through a bull's nose.
The rest of the room appears to be an intricate laboratory filled with equipment and tools.The door seems weathered but solidly constructed.
"Instead of a keyhole, there is a small magic circle inscribed above the burnished handle."
You enter a large dining hall.
"To the left small, glum-looking gargoyle shaped like a horned cat with wings sits in front of a fireplace."
Its skin is cracked and flaking.
"There is a door on the opposite wall that has been barricaded with a bookshelf, an overturned table, and several wooden chairs."
There is another closed door to the far right.
"The room is dusty but comfortably furnished with stuffed chairs, bookshelves, and unremarkable paintings."
"Set into the center of every wall, 5 feet high, there is a dark orb about the size of a melon."
"To your immediate right, there is a lever set into the wall surrounded by magic runes."
The ceiling is a concave glass dome that magically reflects the weather outside.
The smell of dust and mold assaults your nose.
Rusty utensils and dirty pans are scattered across the counter tops.
"As you look closer, you are disturbed to recognize that the platters of moldering food are your favorite dishes and desserts, things that never fail to remind you of home and your childhood."
The inside of the door has been hacked and splintered with edged weapons.
"A wide corridor extends to the left and right, turning corners at both ends."
To the right there is a heavy wooden door set in the opposite wall and another door at the end of the corridor.
It seems at first that three suits of plate armor stand as decorations but as they turn your direction you can see a skull inside each open helmet.
The armored skeletons lift their weapons and charge.
The orbs of light activate and shed light on an armory and storage room.
"The room is divided into aisles by six long, tall shelves full of all manner of equipment, though two of the shelves have collapsed, creating mounds of junk."
The wall nearest the door is fit with weapon racks and armor stands.
"Three more armored skeletons are engaged in various tasks, sweeping the floor with a broom worn down to a nub or sharpening swords down to little more than slivers of metal."
The skeletons draw their weapons and attack.
"From the corner of your eye, this corridor seems to stretch much farther than it really does."
Wooden doors line the corridor every 15 feet on the left and there is a door at the far end.
"The bedroom is filled with things that remind you of home, only twisted and broken."
Paintings of familiar places have been slashed with clawed hands.
Pieces of cultural art and childhood toys lie shattered on the floor.
The blankets are threadbare and frayed.
"Demonic graffiti covers the walls in what you hope is flaking red paint, darkened with age."
This corridor turns to the left up ahead.
There is a closed iron door on the far right.
"To the near right is a wooden door, slightly ajar."
"Bookshelves line every wall of this room from floor to ceiling, save for a small, unlit fireplace in the corner."
The shelves are in disarray and only half-filled.
"Books, scrolls, and papers litter the shelves, floor, small table, and chair."
"A broken door lies at the far end of this corridor, twisted from its hinges by an incredible force."
"The open doorway flickers with erratic white flashes in time with short, sharp buzzing noises."
This room is dimly lit by a blue glow that intensifies and fades like slow breathing.
Two barred cells take up the majority of the space.
The first cell is empty but covered in scorch marks and scrawls of chalk.
The second cell is occupied by an elf woman made of translucent blue light.
"The ghost sits on top of a skeleton, weeping into her hands, on a rotting bed of straw."
Your eyes water at the stink of chemicals and death.
The large room is lit by luminous orbs and extends to your left where there is a closed stone door set into a carven arch.
Broken shelves and tables are strewn about the edges of the room and the floor is covered in broken glass as well as a number of multi-colored puddles.
A nine-foot tall humanoid lying on a table is connected to a large machine set against the far wall.
The machine flickers and sparks with lightning.
On the side of the machine is a switch in the up position.
There is a silver key on a chain set around the humanoid’s neck.
This once beautiful chapel has been utterly destroyed and defiled.
The walls are covered in profane writing and crude pictograms of torture.
"The middle of the floor is dominated by a huge pile of splintered furniture, bent candlesticks, shredded tapestries, and other destroyed religious paraphernalia."
A thick layer of scum covers the surface of a rectangular pool along the far wall.
"To the far left, across the pile of junk, stands an altar with an unlit candle at each of the four corners."
"Several alcoves are embedded in the walls, each containing an elven skeleton."
"There is a large stone sarcophagus in the middle of the room, engraved with elven poetry."
You push open the double doors and reveal an eerie shrine.
"Large pillars flank the statue of an elf maiden, with large wings and a longsword in her hands."
"Beneath the statue, you see a young half-elf woman, tied with ropes and guarded by two kobolds."
The statue depicts a winged elven warrior.
"The first floor has a front door that leads to the street, the door is closed but not locked."
"There are five windows on the first floor that are locked, with a simple lock DC 5 to pick."
There is a trap door on the back of the house that will lead to the basement.
"On the second floor, there are five windows that are not locked and are open."
There are currently two ways into the basement.
One is from the unlocked trap door in room 4 on the first floor.
The other is from the trap door in the back of the house.
The trap door leading to the basement from outside is locked with a heavy padlock requiring a DC10 check to unlock or break it.
The front door of the family home opens to reveal a long hallway with family knickknacks and various pieces of clothing and shoes against the walls.
The air is damp and indiscernible from the outside chill.
A heavily bloodied man lays sprawled over the threshold to room 1.
"Another door is located directly across, leading to room 2."
The opened door reveals a wooden dining table with four scattered chairs.
Two bookshelves can be seen in the corners of the room.
The bookshelves contain texts on local geography and animal life.
There is a weathered copy of a popular children’s fairytale laying sideways on the bottom shelf.
"A wooden table is seen immediately near the door, there are a few cooking materials and food ingredients scattered on it."
"A cupboard is in the corner, alongside a small sink."
"The cupboard holds a small collection of dishes, some canned fruit, and jerky."
"A large, lived-in room with an extinguished fire."
"There is a small writing table, a comfortable easy chair near the fireplace, and a scratched and worn cushioned bench."
There is a nearly empty bookshelf near the bench in the corner.
"This room contains several shelves and seems to serve as a storage space for foodstuff, clothing, and damaged texts."
A staircase is located near the interior doorway.
"There is a small door leading beneath the floor, diagonal from the entrance."
This is a disheveled space with more dusty texts and a small table with a lamp.
Opening this door will reveal two small beds and chests.
There is a shelf with a few toys and a popular children’s story.
There is a dark fireplace in the corner.
Next to the fireplace are two comfortable-looking armchairs and a small table.
"Inside this room, there’s a double bed, a chest, and another bookshelf filled seemingly with junk."
"After descending, it becomes clear that all of the various pieces of furniture in this room are broken and splintered into pieces."
"There is a cold, clammy feeling in the air."
Small noises can be heard in the next area through a stone wall.
There is a larger area through the stone wall doorway.
"Directly in the middle of this room, there’s a large animal cage with two humans inside, packed around each other."
"Around them, a summoning circle is drawn."
The cage in the middle of the room is locked with a heavy padlock requiring a DC 15 check to break or pick.
"The tables are full of drinking, swearing, and bragging adventurers of all races."
Several people are studying a job board spread across one wall.
The interior is well lit and features a glass counter displaying a handful of potions.
A halfling wearing spectacles and a lab coat smiles at your arrival but then suddenly gasps as a shape scurries across the room: a giant albino rat! Shelves display vials containing liquids of questionable color and odor.
"Many of the vessels are smashed, their contents spilled on the floor and in the air."
"On a nearby table are alchemy supplies, which have also been destroyed, as well as a lockbox."
In the center of the cellar is a drain connecting to the sewer.
Between the shelves and the drain are tufts of fur and bits of bone: the remains of three giant rats.
Three lanterns provide ample light.
"Before long, it becomes difficult to identify anything further than arm’s length."
"Statues flanking either side of the sole entrance to the structure depict the Archmage, or so you assume, adorned with flowing robes and a crystalline staff."
"Pillars of marble line the front face of the building, and a set of iron doors with gold filigree rest slightly ajar."
"Inside the mausoleum, a family of eight mages and warriors rest in sarcophagi lining all sides of the room."
"A statue is sculpted atop each casket’s lid, depicting its occupant."
"In the back of the room a more ornate statue, decorated with gemstones aplenty, stands behind a ninth coffin."
"You can only assume the coffin, made entirely of gold, contains the remains of the Archmage."
No sign of the famed crypt can be found.
"The eyes of each statue are wide open, staring at the party as they cross the room."
The room below the mausoleum is the first of many in the Archmage’s crypt.
The crypt is designed to lay waste to those who attempt to steal the Archmage’s treasure after their death.
"Bare rock forms the walls of this dingy room, as though it were carved out of the earth itself."
Four sconces mark the corners of the area; their amber glow illuminating a large puddle in the center of the room.
"Two iron doors flank the room on either side, with a large keyhole embedded in each."
A common passage is written in golden ink along one of the longer walls of the room.
"The doors of this room are sealed, requiring a key to unlock them."
The key can be forged by using blood to draw the shape of a key on the wall beneath the inscription.
"Four massive pillars of stone, extending about a dozen feet from floor to ceiling, corner this cavernous room."
"The walls are made entirely of bones, mainly skulls, from countless indistinguishable creatures."
"Across the floor on the far wall of the room, a large iron door leads into the next area."
"In front of the door, however, a monstrous being blocks your path."
"Seemingly composed of the flesh of the creatures lining the walls, a floating sphere with a single giant eye waits, several feet off the ground."
"Fleshy tentacles protrude from the being, each with an eye of its own."
"As you enter the room, all eyes are on you."
Your walk through the small hallway leading to the next room is hindered by a thick wall of webbing.
"Sticky and hard to navigate, the webs are much too large to be mere cobwebs."
The room at the end of the hallway is longer than it is wide.
"Like a dining room from a long since abandoned mansion, the room is lined with dust- covered tables; on top of them, a spoiled feast is set forth."
"Flies circle the rotten meat laying on plates and serving trays, while lifeless corpses sit in chairs surrounding the horrific sight."
"Four dyed ropes of varying colors hang from a ceiling that is far too high to see in the dark of the dungeon: one red, one green, one blue, and one black."
"On the far side of the room a large iron door is closed, flush with the wall."
"No handle protrudes from the door, and there are no creases by which it could be pried open."
Inside this ornate chamber is a small church of sorts.
"An altar rests upon a raised dais at the back of the room, engraved with a divine symbol."
The symbol depicts a white skull set inside a black triangle.
"Behind the altar, a creature appears to be giving a sermon to a mass of zombies."
"The being, adorned with the robes of a mage and wielding a staff, stares at you with icy blue eyes as you enter."
"With a quick motion, the doors behind you slam closed, and the creature gestures toward you."
"With a guttural growl, the zombie congregation turns and marches toward you."
A small circular intersection opens up before you.
"Ahead and behind you, two corridors lead in opposite directions."
"On the wall between the two hallways, the statue of a mage towers over you, with a staff pointing forwards."
"The statue, carved from marble, is embedded with an assortment of gemstones and fine metals."
A large crystal ball is affixed to the end of the staff.
"Across from the statue, a large iron door rests slightly ajar, with firelight radiating from the other side."
Atop the altar lays an unholy symbol of Myrkul.
The short tunnel leading to this area is lined with a half dozen torches to light your way.
"At the end of the path, you find yourself atop a 5 foot stone platform at the end of a 90 foot hallway."
Affixed to the wall atop the platform is a torch much different from the others you have come across.
"This torch glows with a green flame, casting everything around you in an emerald hue."
"Beneath the platform, and down a set of stairs carved from stone, an opaque red substance fills the hallway."
"At the far side of the hallway, through the darkness, you see a pedestal rising from the liquid below."
"A humanoid skull rests atop it, lit by candle light."
The room on the other side of door is filled with adventurers just like yourself.
"Many laugh and converse around the room, while others sit and drink at a fully stocked bar on the far side."
Nobody acknowledges your presence as you enter.
There is no bartender manning the bar.
"This area is a small room, resembling any tavern in the realm."
"The occupants are illusions, who can be passed through and cannot interact with the party."
"The furniture, drinks, and food within the room are real, however."
"Behind an iron cage-like door, locked with a large padlock, lies a small treasure trove."
"Piles of gold and gemstones lay about the floor, as high as a full-grown orc in some areas."
"Weapons, armor, and tools of all sorts line the walls of this small room."
"The vault before you is immaculately clean, though no creatures are present."
"The vault is locked behind an iron door, but there are no magic barriers."
The walls of this large room are lined on one side with a tapestry depicting the life of the Archmage.
"The human’s rise to power, their accumulation of wealth, and the creation of the vault beneath their tomb are all illustrated in beautiful and colorful embroidery."
"On the opposite side of the room, three identical iron doors are set into the wall, unlocked."
This room at the top of the staircase has four entrances.
"Two of the entrances are trapped, and one is hidden behind the tapestry."
This small but well-decorated room is filled with musical instruments.
"A plethora of lutes, flutes, pipe, and drums float around the room- playing themselves magically."
The combined sounds of the instruments form a beautiful song.
"In the center of the room, a pedestal holds an ornate, wooden box."
"The box, left open and angled towards the entrance, holds the only instrument not being played: a silver flute."
"The stairway leads to a seven-foot iron door, upon which an engraving depicts the Archmage himself."
"The head of the mage has been removed, however, and a foot-wide indentation is carved into the door in its place."
"Though there is no keyhole, the door will not budge, appearing to be magically locked."
"In this massive square room, four iron statues stand at each corner."
"Each wielding a massive warhammer, they stand in front of enormous drums of various colors."
There is no other entrance or exit in the room.
The chamber behind the enchanted door is filled with treasure and magic items of unfathomable value.
"In the center of the room, the remaining bones of the Archmage levitate several feet from the floor, properly assembled."
"Around their bones, the Archmage’s ghostly form stares at you.""Beyond the overgrown boulder lies a massive, worn room."
"It's covered in cobwebs, dead insects and large bones."
"Your torch allows you to see an altar, frayed and butchered by time itself."
"Further ahead are two paths, you take the left."
Its twisted trail leads passed pillaged rooms and soon you enter a foggy area.
Rows upon rows of shelves are packed with books or remnants of books.
In the center sits a single skeleton.
"What happened in this place? You advance carefully onwards, deeper into the dungeon's expanse."
"You pass countless passages, each seem to go on forever, leading to who knows what."
You eventually make it to what is likely the final room.
An enormous metal door blocks your path.
"Countless odd symbols are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements."
You step closer to inspect it and you're pretty sure you're being watched.
