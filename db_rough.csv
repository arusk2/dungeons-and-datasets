"Decades, centuries perhaps."
This room has an eerie vibe to it.

The floor in here is stained with blood in many places.
There is a long table holding various rusted implements which are scattered here and there.

"There is a rancid smell in here, the smell of stale sweat and death, and you wonder how much awful suffering must have occurred in this forsaken place."

"The air in here is musty, and every step you take raises a little cloud of dust."
"The smell of moth-eaten tapestries permeates the air, and as you move about in in this strange, museum-like room, you are taken aback at the artefacts on display."
"Shrunken heads in glass cases, suits of armour, and shelves of ornate daggers from faraway lands catch your eye."
"There is a rack of exotic swords on display, and many ancient artworks, including one huge painting which appears to be a commissioned portrait of the Master of the Lair themselves! There are also several bookshelves loaded with rare tomes and some strange pieces of anatomy suspended in jars of preserving fluid."
"A noxious, rank odour just about knocks you flat as you enter this room."
"Every lair needs a privy, and this particular one appears to be undergoing heavy use."
This toilet is disgusting.
It consists of a wooden bench- seat against the back wall with a hold in it where one’s posterior is placed.
"Apparently uncleaned for a long time, the seat of this throne is stained and flies buzz about thickly in here."
It is all you can do to keep your last meal down.
A bucket of stagnant water and a mop sit in the corner.
"A fecal odour hits your nostrils, but it is somewhat subdued."
"Perhaps this privy has not been used in a while, but nonetheless it is not a pleasant place to linger, The walls are dirty, and a simple wooden bench with a hole in it sits against the back wall."
"A bucket, perhaps once used for cleaning, is knocked over on the floor with a dried up old mop nearby."
"The acrid tang of steel is heavy on the air, and on the far side of the room a forge emits a tremendous amount of heat."
The air is absolutely stifling in here.

Piles of raw steel bars and timber sit waiting to be used.
