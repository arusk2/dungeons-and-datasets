"Warm afternoon sunlight pours through the large windows of the library which, combined with the droning voice of your mentor, Master Elias, creates an intensely soporific effect."A massive stone room serves as Lieutenant Bharmyr’s training area."In one area, castle carpenters have  erected a massive obstacle course to simulate a  variety of combat scenarios.""Behind the structure, a sand pit serves as a practice arena.""Suddenly, the light from the magic torches illuminating the room flickers and then goes out."Darkness surrounds you.You wind your way down a spiral staircase enclosed within thick stone walls."At the bottom, a narrow hallway leads to a tall iron door."The two guards standing watch over the Teleportation Circle nod at your approach and open the door."Inside the gray ancient chamber, Master Elias fusses about the edge of a circle of intricate lines."Arcane runes pulsate in rhythm to his utterances.The wooden door creaks open to reveal a large stone chamber."On the far side of the room, a partial cave-in emits sunlight and snow among the piles of boulders.""Icy white tendrils stretch across the carved stone floor, offset by intricate, faded frescoes that adorn the walls of this long-abandoned space."The runes above the door are written in an ancient language with Elvish roots.Intricate designs weave across the door’s  surface and meet at the center in a shape familiar to the PC—it matches the design on their amulet."The frescoes around the room depict an ancient, desperate battle between the forces of good and ill.""Demons fight side-by-side with chromatic dragons against an increasingly dwindling and desperate group of celestials and heroes, struggling in vain against the overwhelming forces of their enemies."You pause as your senses adjust to the darkness of the lower level."Ahead, you perceive two imposing silhouettes from the fallen stone column.""A long hallway stretches beyond the rubble, leading to a door carved to resemble a face."The massive pillars have brought down the .ceiling but can be scrambled over without too much difficulty."At the end of the hall, a magical, talking door inhibits further access to the underground chambers."The door is extremely gregarious and beside himself to have someone to talk to after all these years.Over the door are the words “Open Says Me” in Elvish."This circular room is in complete darkness, rendering even dark vision useless without a light source."Four unused torches hang along the stone walls beyond the door."As you say the word “open,” the door exclaims in surprise and slides into the wall.""Beyond him, a short flight of stairs leads down into utter darkness, the likes of which not even dark vision can penetrate.""The faint light reflecting off of the collections of snow behind you casts faint, torch-shaped shadows against the wall on either side of the stairs.""Glancing around, you note that you are in a small but cozy hut."The strong smell of sage and rosemary greet your nose as she briefly tends the fire before turning her piercing gaze on you."Each home has been integrated into the natural environment so thoroughly that only the slight aberrations in natural decor—an abundance of flowers, carefully patterned vines, or organized collections of herbs—distinguish them from their organic surroundings."The lower level boasts a beautiful courtyard and garden with several generously-sized suites for those looking to pay a bit extra."The rooms on the top floor are more modest, though still comfortable.""Light, airy fabrics compliment the sawn-wood floors and white walls of the town’s finest establishment."The bottom floor of the structure serves as a place where villagers can seek an audience with her and the upper floors provide a luxurious residence.On the mantle downstairs is a note in a rough hand.The Temple of Waukeen is beautifully adorned with daffodils all around the grounds."On either side of the main entrance, a pair of gilded lions stand guard."The smaller front portion of the temple hosts tall windows through which a modest sanctuary can be seen with a few benches for supplicants and parishioners to rest and meditate."Inside, an elegant statue of the Golden Lady nearly reaches the temple’s ceiling; she stands with hands facing outward, her long hair flowing wildly around her.""To either side, golden scales further beautify the altar.""There are two doors, one leading to the cleric’s study and the other to the back where the new construction is taking place."
