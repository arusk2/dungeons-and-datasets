"Warm afternoon sunlight pours through the large windows of the library which, combined with the droning voice of your mentor, Master Elias, creates an intensely soporific effect."A massive stone room serves as Lieutenant Bharmyr’s training area."In one area, castle carpenters have  erected a massive obstacle course to simulate a  variety of combat scenarios.""Behind the structure, a sand pit serves as a practice arena.""Suddenly, the light from the magic torches illuminating the room flickers and then goes out."Darkness surrounds you.You wind your way down a spiral staircase enclosed within thick stone walls."At the bottom, a narrow hallway leads to a tall iron door."The two guards standing watch over the Teleportation Circle nod at your approach and open the door."Inside the gray ancient chamber, Master Elias fusses about the edge of a circle of intricate lines."Arcane runes pulsate in rhythm to his utterances.The wooden door creaks open to reveal a large stone chamber."On the far side of the room, a partial cave-in emits sunlight and snow among the piles of boulders.""Icy white tendrils stretch across the carved stone floor, offset by intricate, faded frescoes that adorn the walls of this long-abandoned space."The runes above the door are written in an ancient language with Elvish roots.Intricate designs weave across the door’s  surface and meet at the center in a shape familiar to the PC—it matches the design on their amulet."The frescoes around the room depict an ancient, desperate battle between the forces of good and ill.""Demons fight side-by-side with chromatic dragons against an increasingly dwindling and desperate group of celestials and heroes, struggling in vain against the overwhelming forces of their enemies."You pause as your senses adjust to the darkness of the lower level."Ahead, you perceive two imposing silhouettes from the fallen stone column.""A long hallway stretches beyond the rubble, leading to a door carved to resemble a face."The massive pillars have brought down the .ceiling but can be scrambled over without too much difficulty."At the end of the hall, a magical, talking door inhibits further access to the underground chambers."The door is extremely gregarious and beside himself to have someone to talk to after all these years.Over the door are the words “Open Says Me” in Elvish."This circular room is in complete darkness, rendering even dark vision useless without a light source."Four unused torches hang along the stone walls beyond the door."As you say the word “open,” the door exclaims in surprise and slides into the wall.""Beyond him, a short flight of stairs leads down into utter darkness, the likes of which not even dark vision can penetrate.""The faint light reflecting off of the collections of snow behind you casts faint, torch-shaped shadows against the wall on either side of the stairs.""Glancing around, you note that you are in a small but cozy hut."The strong smell of sage and rosemary greet your nose as she briefly tends the fire before turning her piercing gaze on you."Each home has been integrated into the natural environment so thoroughly that only the slight aberrations in natural decor—an abundance of flowers, carefully patterned vines, or organized collections of herbs—distinguish them from their organic surroundings."The lower level boasts a beautiful courtyard and garden with several generously-sized suites for those looking to pay a bit extra."The rooms on the top floor are more modest, though still comfortable.""Light, airy fabrics compliment the sawn-wood floors and white walls of the town’s finest establishment."The bottom floor of the structure serves as a place where villagers can seek an audience with her and the upper floors provide a luxurious residence.On the mantle downstairs is a note in a rough hand.The Temple of Waukeen is beautifully adorned with daffodils all around the grounds."On either side of the main entrance, a pair of gilded lions stand guard."The smaller front portion of the temple hosts tall windows through which a modest sanctuary can be seen with a few benches for supplicants and parishioners to rest and meditate."Inside, an elegant statue of the Golden Lady nearly reaches the temple’s ceiling; she stands with hands facing outward, her long hair flowing wildly around her.""To either side, golden scales further beautify the altar.""There are two doors, one leading to the cleric’s study and the other to the back where the new construction is taking place.""Inside this room, you see that the cave continues to the north, though darkness obscures the area beyond the opening."There are two other openings: a large one to the east and a crawl space to the west.A thick layer of an unknown organic substance coats the eastern passage but seems especially thick to the west."The room smells of decay, likely from the partly decomposed bodies scattered about the space."There is also a large cluster of mushrooms against the back wall.This space is made even more crowded by the four small mold people holding simple spears up at you."Sunlight pours down into this opening in the cave and a knot of vegetation has taken root, choking this outlet."This large opening is faintly lit by bioluminescent fungus.The ornate double doors are free of the vines that cover the rest of the building.There are dozens of runes burned into the wood of the doors.The rusted iron gate stands partially open."Amazingly, the grass and weeds beyond the gate have grown almost to the height of the wall itself turning the interior courtyard into a labyrinth of vegetation.""As you step into the foyer, the main hallway on the first floor is directly in front of you."There is a closed door to your left and a stairwell to your right leading to the second floor.This 15 x 15 room contains a comfortable sofa and chairs.The quality material and engraved wood mark these items of furniture to be of high quality.On a coffee table in the middle of the room is a glass decanter of glowing violet liquid.A long lonely crafted dining table dominates the center of the room.Sitting in each of the eight chairs around the table are skeletal remains dressed in fine attire.Shockingly the head of each dinner guest is missing.Set out in front of each skeleton is a large plate with a dome cover.The table is also adorned with fine cutlery and two silver candelabras.On the south wall is a large painting of the full moon.The 20 x 20 parlor room contains comfortable chairs and other fine furnishings.In the corner of the room is a large ornate vase.Up against the south wall is a matching pair of wooden chairs and a solid block table with a marble surface marked into black and white squares."To the left, a book stand with dusty books is found.""Pieces have been laid out on a chess board, a popular game played amongst nobility."It appears as if someone left a game unfinished."This 25 x 20 room is filled with two ornate divans, several chairs and tables.""The walls of the room are entirely covered with mounted butterflies of all shapes, sizes and colors.""To the right, a book stand with dusty books is found."Sitting on one of the tables is a jar which contains what appear to be three live butterflies.At the bottom of a jar is a golden yellow gemstone.This 15 x 35 room once served as the manors kitchen.The room has several work tables and a large fireplace dominates the northern wall.There is a large collection of cooking utensils and pans."A narrow stairwell leads up to the second floor, and a door to the left of the fireplace appears to lead outside."Sitting on the largest of the tables is a wooden bowl containing three oddly colored apples."There is a bright blue one, a bright red one and one that is yellow.""A tall chubby butler with a chefs hat is setting the table, and greets you."You open the door in the east wall of the kitchen and discover an impenetrable darkness beyond.The entire house seems to shiver and creak as the floor boards lightly expand and contract."You feel a dark cold energy emanating from the creature that just entered the manor, and an involuntary shiver runs through your spine."At the top of the stairs a hallway runs the entire length of the west side of the manor.There must be an open window nearby as there is a slight breeze in the air."This 15 x 20 room contains a bed, dresser and chair, all of unremarkable quality.""On the left wall, you see a mouse hole."The item of furniture that captures your attention is the ornate chest resting in the northwest corner.It appears to be made of wood of a reddish hue and is bound in copper."The chest, which was two feet in height, now stands at over twenty feet tall.""In fact, the entire room has grown."The twenty feet from one wall to the other now spans over two hundred.This 15 x 20 room is adorned with a large four post bed with a canopy curtain.The bed is set with crimson blankets and gold colored pillows.There is also a large wooden dresser which appears to be made of cherry wood.Sitting on the dresser is a fine set of silver grooming items.Shelves containing hundreds of books line the walls of this 20 x 30 library.A large oak desk dominates the middle of the room.The legs of the desk are carved to resemble coiled dragons.Behind it is a chair of similar design.In one corner of this library stands an assembled suit of plate mail armor clutching a sword.On the desk is a leather bound volume and what looks to be an iron candelabra fashioned to resemble a hydra with nine heads.Some papers with diagrams lie beneath the tome.You open the door to a closet and see a completely empty 10 x 10 room inside.You are momentarily startled and something unseen brushes across your feet.The trap door opens into a windowless 15 x 20 room.The only item of furniture is a square table with a candle on it.Hanging by its neck from a ceiling beam is the body of a woman.She appears to be similarly dressed to rivana greywire and is clutching a skull in her dead hands.This appears to be the private changing room of astabar.This 15 x 20 room contains an ornate desk with a mirror and a chair.Along the east wall are pegs from which hang a variety of wizardly robes.Anyone looking directly into the mirror will see shimmering colors dance and play in the reflection of the room.This room has no other exits.This well-lit 20 x 25 chamber is the master bedroom of the wizard astabar.The light is coming from a glass sphere sitting on a dresser.Inside the sphere appears to be a fiery inferno.There is a large bed adorned with furs and a high backed chair with a battle scene between elves and goblins carved into the wood.The glass sphere gives off heat and is somewhat hot the touch (easily handled with gloves).When you open the door to this 10 x 20 room you are surprised to find rain pouring from the ceiling.Mold and other vegetation has grown across the floor and walls.At the far end of the chamber is a metal tub which is overflowing with algae filled water.You reach a small empty wooden room."You hear thunderstorms coming from above, outside the house, despite being a sunny day when you entered.""In front of you, you can see a metallic door whose hue is continually shifting through all the colors in the rainbow.""There is no handle, but a large silver look is visible in the center of the door."This large cluttered room runs almost the entire length of the building."It is filled with rows of standing bookshelves, loaded with books, magical reagents, and all manner of strange objects of both occult and mundane nature.""Throughout the room, you see dozens of humanoid spirits taking shape and staring at you.""Some root for you, ""quick, you can do it, stop him once and for all! "".""Others advise you to be careful or hurry, ""he wont take long."Hurry up."Others are simply crying from their suffering."Rivana shows up to guide the characters, ""break the ritual."The wand of wonder is the only thing keeping his soul here."Once he is gone, we will all be free."""" on the far side of the room you see a wooden arch leading to another room."A purple light glows from within."The room is filled with many different items that are odd, but very few are magical."You cross the archway and find yourself in astabars study.There are several tables covered in vials and bottles of various components and materials.A large bookshelf holds several dozen volumes of magic lore.On the table in the middle of the room there is a multicolored wand shaped to resemble a unicorns horn.It is floating on top of what looks like a demonic circle drawn on the tabletop.It is emitting a bright purple light."It is three stories high, and covered in vines.""The building is squat and functional, and rises to a stone dome."The only markings revealing its religious dedication are on the doors to the outside.You emerge from a thicket of briars into a small clearing in front of a crumbling three story stone building.An overgrown path opens into a clearing containing a pool filled with stagnant water."The path continues up to a large stone door leading into the building, emblazoned with a sunburst and coiled snake motif.""The pool is filled with water to a depth of about 2ft, and emits is a terrible stench of rotting meat."The door opens into a large dusty entrance hall.A wooden staircase with a polished banister curves upwards around the room.In the gloom of the ceiling above the center of the room is a golden chandelier that glints in the dim light filtering in from outside."Passages lead from the chamber to the north, east and west.""Eight wooden desks and chairs are arranged neatly for work in this chamber, covered in undisturbed thick dust."Several alcoves reach from floor to ceiling around the walls and within each are shelves piled high with scrolls.Two long wooden tables dominate the center of this room."Bowls, chopping boards and other kitchen implements are arranged on the tables and hanging from the walls.""The overall impression is one of neatness and order, though the thick layer of dust that covers all the surfaces suggest that whoever arranged this room has not been back for a very long time.""Two staircases lead out of the room, one downwards and one upwards.""Magically preserved food can be found on shelves in the alcoves, mostly grain and root vegetables."A feast is laid out on a long table before you."15 places have been set, and the table piled high with a side of pork, roasted vegetables, stews and a tureen of a greenish soup.""Despite the covering of dust, wafts of steam still float up from the soup, and the food smells excellent.""What once must have been a charming, sun-kissed veranda is now overgrown with vines and briars.""Five nearly identical statues stand along the edge of the veranda depicting a naked man, arms held upward in supplication.""Each man has a different animals head - a ram, an eagle, a serpent, a heron and a beetle."Short flights of stairs lead down into the gloom of the woods."A small animal skeleton rests next to the statue with the beetles head, at the southerly end of the veranda.""A broken water tank has collapsed in the center of this room, covering the floor of this cellar with ankle-deep water.""Trickles spill from broken pipe work in the southeast corner, and the walls drip with condensation."A pack of filthy rats glare at you and hiss when you enter this room.A swarm of eight rats make this room their den."They attack anyone entering here, but will not pursue beyond the door to this room.""Sturdy tables are covered with tools and crafting implements, and a small forge and anvil rests in the southwest corner of this workshop.""A small collection of rusted weapons - spears, arrows and swords - is carelessly stacked in one corner."The door to the east is swollen shut with water.Upon opening it floodwaters pour into the room.Boxes are piled high in the corners of this dank cellar."A door leads to the south, covered by an iron portcullis, with a winch next to it.""Bright light floods from two glowing globes hanging from the ceiling and a verdant, earthy scent wafts out of this room.""Plants and creepers have overgrown the chamber, covering every available surface."Shattered glass covers the floor."On one table, an intact alembic still stands, nestled by the green fronds, containing an effervescing pink liquid.""A set of rotten couches and meditation stools are arranged haphazardly around this room, whilst light streams through dirty windows."The doors to this chamber are protected by a permanent alarm spell that makes a sound like a ringing hand bell."This room was once the herbalists indoor laboratory, where he worked with the local plant specimens he gathered."Bundles of notes charting plant growth and herbal experiments can be found in a drawer in one of the tables here."The door to the room hangs ajar, and peering beyond you see a simple bedchamber containing a desk and 2 chairs.""More arresting is the skeleton lying in the doorway, a rusted spear embedded in its ribcage."This spacious yet spartan living chamber appears to have been undisturbed for decades."Simple furniture - a bed, a desk and some shelves - has been arranged tidily around the room.""Lying on the bed, eyes closed, hands clasped over its chest, is a human figure dressed in white robes.""A couple of small wooden desks line the walls of this dusty chamber, with blank paper neatly stacked to one side."In one corner of the room sits a small iron-bound chest.The chest is trapped to prevent petty pilferers with a simple poison needle trap."The staircase winds upwards, giving an better view of the chandelier.""From here, you can see several small golden sun and-stars trinkets dangling from it.""More pressing, a humanoid figure dressed in white robes waits at the top of the stairs, staring blankly.""Rows of simple wooden pallets arranged in this room, without sheets or mattresses.""White robed figures lying prone on four of these uncomfortable beds are still, until, in unison, their glowing eyes turn toward you.""Stairs lead up into the darkness from here, covered with a trail of long-dried blood.""From the top of the stairs, the room stretches left and right to two identical wings."Long wooden benches rest against the walls."In the center of each wing stands a pillar, carved in the form of heron-headed lathander.""A pile of empty vials, some smashed, is in the eastern corner of the right wing.""An eerie violet light flickers here, illuminating murals on the walls depicting the rebirth god Lathander in different poses - beckoning, kneeling, or prone."The murals have been defaced with runes daubed on in dried blood."The light comes from candles set in skulls on a table at one end of the room, draped in a ragged black cloth.""Lying on the ground in various poses of disarray are 7 white robed humans, as if sleeping.""Another figure kneels before the shrine, dressed in a golden robe.""It turns as you enter, revealing a face with desiccated skin drawn tight over the skull.""Eyeless sockets stare at you, as it grabs a gleaming mace from beneath the shrine.""A walkway spans round the building here, giving a dizzy-making view of the forest floor below.""What perhaps once were entrances to the building have been bricked over, and covered with arcane scribbles."The air is thick in this glade."Dust and snow swirls around as the shadows from the canopy above crowd in, and its getting caught in silky and barely perceptible webs.""An audible clicking sound can be heard over the crunching of snow, and a humanoid-shaped cocoon hangs from a tree branch.""The wind is calmer here, blocked by the sturdy structure that lies in front of you.""The snow has piled on this side, and looks precarious on the roofs above."This door into the tower is on the leeward side of the structure.The entry hall is a small 25 x 15 foot room with 10 foot high ceilings.The entry hall looks as though it doesn't get much use and only has a few dim lanterns hanging from the rafters.The roof is made of wood and very dry.The rest of the room is given over to empty food barrels and crates.A large painting of an elvish king hangs on one of the walls."Rats scurry about, but pay you no mind."The main hall of the tower is 35 feet in diameter and has 20 foot high ceilings on each floor."A large fire is roaring in the hearth opposite the door from the Entry Hall, and the whole hall is filled with its warmth and the smell of some tantalizing stew."A large table dominates the center of the room sitting atop a plush dark blue carpet."At the head of the table (and approximately in the center of the chamber) is a large wooden chair, etched with many unique symbols.""The second floor of the tower is largely given over to beds, dressers and old footlockers piled haphazardly on the far side of the room from the stairs.""Some beds have been arranged in a usable manner, however, and even have fresh linens on them for sleeping."The top of the tower is a cold and exposed location.A large brazier dominates the roof and ballista are visibly mounted on the crenelations."A lonely wight stand guard on top of the tower, not bothered by the cold.""Without facing you, you hear his raspy voice.""""Chilly evening, isn't it? Perhaps a bit too chilly..."The bones of numerous creatures are piled high in each corner and litter the floor.Some skeletons are still manacled to the walls.The shelves and cabinets lining the wall are covered with bones and the dried blood.The putrid stench almost makes you gag."The furniture once held glimmering weapons and armor, but has now fallen into disrepair.""This narrow dark tunnel is moist and cold, and the lack of cobwebs shows that it is walked often.""This underground chamber is a laboratory, home to a wide variety of aberrant experiments."The room contains two long tables that have several dead horde goblins laying on them.The back of their skulls have been broken open and nothing remains in their heads."Behind them, a Mindflayer stands, looking at a bowl of clear liquid.""Nezureth's chambers are lit by a single crystal giving off a macabre, blood red light.""The furniture looks old, dusty, and undisturbed.""Different from the previous rooms, this tunnel has been dug without much care, and the uneven jagged walls can easily scrape distracted wanderers.""Damp air seems to rise from the darkness, and a foul smell with it."You can see a large set of double doors almost dead center of the front facade."At one time, there also seems to have been several windows looking out at the forest path, but they are all currently bricked-up."The remains of a smashed and weather beaten carriage sits in the middle of the path exactly where it ends and there is overgrown grass and plant life to either side of the building more than six feet tall."The double front doors are made out of mahogany with intricate carving patterns and impressive iron locks, all of which still appear in good condition."There is also a pulley near the doors connected to a copper bell used to announce visitors."Peering into the thick fog hanging about, you recognize the outline of a vegetable garden in the back yard of the mansion."It looks to be terribly overgrown but you can still make out several kinds of vegetables now growing wild."There is an old and weathered wooden sign that has been staked into the ground which reads, No Trespassers! The mansion has a single backdoor.""As you enter through the creaky yet solid front doors, the smell of musty and moldy air hits your noses."There is also a chill in the air that makes you shiver.Immediately to the west is a closed door that does not appear to be locked.To the east is a second door as well as a set of stairs going up to the second floor.The stairs are horribly rotten and do not look very safe."Up ahead there is a long hallway with five doors; two on the east wall, two on the west wall, and one at the very end."Five feet inside the front doors and directly overhead is a huge brass chandelier that holds six glass lanterns on its arms."Opening the door, you see several pieces of furniture."This appears to be a waiting room for visitors."There are two wooden chairs with brown leather seats, a side table with an ashtray, a sitting couch that is brown with red trim, and a knee-high table."There is a cross stitch hanging on the wall that reads Welcome To Our Home."Entering into this room, you instantly feel even colder."This appears to be the VonGlauss Dining Hall and at every seat around the eight person table sits a ghostly apparition.They are all talking and laughing as if they are not out of place at all."In the north-west corner of the room is a banquet table filled with plates, cups, and cutlery."This room contains two very long serving tables filled with mountains of food."However, all does not seem right as the food does not give off any smell or any steam."When you open the door to this room you see a sitting parlor."There are two large brown leather arm chairs, a brown leather couch, and an impressive looking harpsichord in the south-western corner."Peering into this room you discover another parlor.There is a long table covered in a white tablecloth along the same wall as the door and it has a book on top."There is also a wingback chair, another leather couch, a daybed, and a round wooden table in the north-east corner."Sitting on top of the round table is a glass bottle which appears empty.A quick glance at this room reveals it as the kitchen."There are two doors on the south wall, one on the north, and one on the east."There are also a set of stairs leading up to the second floor."Additionally, there is a cutting table, an iron wash stand, and a brick oven."Two of your senses are immediately stimulated as soon as you open this door.The first is smell as this room has a horrible stench to it."It smells of rotting meat, pickles, and mold."The second is hearing as you can easily make out the sound of a woman crying from somewhere deeper into the room.The room itself appears to be a pantry."There are two rows of dual-sided shelves that go from the floor to the ceiling, as well as a few barrels and boxes strewn about."A quick search of the room will reveal another ghost.This room has been decorated for a child."There are many animals painted on the walls as well as a crib in the south-east corner, a chest of drawers on the west wall, and a toy box just to the west of the door.""However, a moment of silence brings a tiny sound to your ears."It sounds like someone breathing."Ascending the stairs, you reach the second floor hallway."It spans the length of the Mansion in an E pattern."The northern arm has a set of stairs heading down to the first floor, a door on the north wall and a door at the end of the hall facing east.""The middle arm has four doors, two on the south wall and two on the north.""The southern arm contains only the rotten stairs; however, along the western wall, there are six paintings hung in the hallway."Each of these paintings is a portrait of a previous matron or patron of the VonGlauss family."Interestingly, there seems to have once hung a seventh painting at the northern end of the hallway, but it has been removed to leave behind a noticeable rectangular void."This room has been decorated for a child."There are many animals painted on the walls as well as a crib in the south-east corner, a chest of drawers on the west wall, and a toy box just to the west of the door.""However, a moment of silence brings a tiny sound to your ears."It sounds like someone breathing."As you open this door, you are met with a guest bedroom.""There is a large four-post canopy bed to the west, a chest of drawers to the east, and a full-body mirror on the south wall."Within moments of opening the door you recognize this place as the library.This 20x30 room is lined on every wall with floor to ceiling bookshelves and every shelf is crammed with volumes.There must be more than two thousand books in total.In the center of the room sits a mahogany table with a single wooden chair.Upon this table lay an iron lockbox."This storage area is filled with brooms, mops, buckets, rags, dusters, and rug beaters.""Also, up on the highest shelf, you notice four glass bottles marked wood polish.""This closet is filled with blankets, sheets, comforters, pillows, throws, and quilts."You open this door to discover the Master Bedroom.There is one door on the north wall as well as a huge bed near the east wall.A chest of drawers sits just along the west wall and there is an old rocking chair in the north-east corner."Finally, along the north wall is the only window in the mansion that has not been bricked up."It is a beautiful stained glass window that depicts the VonGlauss family crest of two cranes on a shield of blue with a silver sword down the middle.Opening the chest of drawers triggers a spell that blasts open the stained glass window and allows three Gargoyles to enter the room."Stepping into this room, you get the impression that it was a lady's dressing room."There is floral patterned wall paper and the whole room smells faintly of perfume.There is a single door in the north east corner of the room."Additionally, there is a makeup desk with a wooden chair along the west wall, a full length mirror on the north wall, and a dozen dresses are hung on hooks adoring the east wall."The last thing that your eyes settle upon is a pine wood hatch in the ceiling that appears to open up to an attic.Opening the door you are greeted with a frightening sight!.Sitting inside a large iron bathtub is the ghost of a naked woman.She is currently holding a knife to her throat and she yells at you to leave her alone.The clothing and the mirror have nothing special about them.The north-east door leads to a small indoor commode."Lifting yourself up into the attic, you look around to see a mostly empty and dusty room.""There is a large black sheet hanging from the west wall, an old table that is cracked and split, and a roughly cut wooden ladder that looks as though it can fit into the hatchway."As you open the door your eyes instantly see two long tables in the center of the room."Both of these are filled with bottles, beakers, tubes, papers, ink jars, and quills."You also notice a large bookshelf along the west wall which is mostly empty and looks like it was cleaned out in a hurry.Immediately to the west of the door sits an iron chest with a large padlock on the front.There is also a huge box in the south-east corner of the room.It has a five-by-five foot base and is ten foot tall.It appears to have been nailed shut by someone using three times more nails than necessary."Finally, you notice that a single book has been left behind and it rests on the floor within a foot of the doorway."This room is very dark and musty."It appears to be a huge L shaped storage area filled with boxes, crates, old and damaged furniture, barrels, and two large piles of items covered with white canvas sheets."There is also a door on the south wall."While you are in this underground room, a sudden rumbling grabs your attention, and the room shakes as an intense earthquake hits the city."People in the room start making their way out to see what is happening."Despite the room having only small shaded windows, the light outside seems to glow purple.""A few moments later, desperate yelling and screams for help can be heard from above, and once again the ground shakes, causing the tavern above you to collapse upon itself.""As you emerge from the basement into a courtyard filled with the debris of the fallen tavern and surrounded by a dust cloud (you cant see more than a few dozen feet in front of you), you begin to hear moaning in the back of your mind."This quickly becomes a scream."Madness grips you, and for a moment you can feel your sanity slipping away."Entrails are strung up around the gate - a grim decoration that confirms the fate of the priests.The temples open-air worshiping area is horribly desecrated.Dark smoke rises from around a burning pyre of furniture and temple items."A towering canine brute picks up an excrement-covered glaive from the ground beside the fire, and two shadows seem to stir from within the fire.""This crumbled building has been burned, smashed, and had its walls desecrated with gnoll bodily fluids."Bits of wooden bunk beds are still smoking around.This round tower has a small slit that allows those inside to watch and shoot enemies on the outer side of the temple.A round red carpet with strange symbols lies beneath your feet."In the walls around the device, a finely painted pictograph depicts some familiar events.""The three-story tower looms in the center of the square, equidistant from all surround buildings.""The sides of the tower are decorated with the colors and symbols of each family, continuously interweaving and mixing."This is the only place you've seen so far where these symbols intermingle in such a way.The heavy and ornamented wooden door has an inscription in draconic.The aura of oppression that emanates from within the gray and bleak tower is palpable."The tall tower, with no windows and a single wooden door, looms menacingly over you, and you feel like you're being watched by some invisible entity.""Behind the barred gates you see small cells, barely big enough for a human adult to lie in.""Most of the buildings are of simple construction, with clean white walls and clay shingles reflecting the many magical red lights floating around.""Occasionally, you see a wider and taller building, with no doors, and pleasant squared sitting areas on its ground floor.""These temples have large golden bells on their ivory towers, and young acolytes bow to you as you pass.""The quartz buildings are often streaked with blue veins, intermingling together to create an impressive pattern that seems to effortlessly flow from one building to another.""Tall and sturdy looking, these homes look big enough to contains multiple families."Calm instrumental music can be heard coming from no specific direction."The large white stone doors are closed, and the stationed guards observe you as you approach."The door seems to open effortlessly as a small and finely dressed female lizardfolk walks out.The dark iron and obsidian buildings appear to dim the twilight."Cold and menacing, even your echoing footsteps on the green-tinted stone roads seem to warrant unwanted attention.""Window shutters are closed as you approach, and groups of lizardfolk actively face and move away from you."Armed guards cross your way multiple times and at least one group at a time seems to trail you from street to street."After you climb in through the trapdoor, you reach an empty 15x15ft room, with four doors, one on each wall.""After you climb in through the trapdoor, you reach the center of a 50x10ft corridor.""On one end lies a statue of a hooded figure, and on the other, a massive stone face is carved on the wall.""On the base of the hooded statue, a gold plaque at its base with an inscription reads When the sun sets in the East, And the Evil comes from the North, The only things opposing them are the Moon and the Saviour.""You stand in a 15x15ft room, and in front of you, an archway leads to a very similar room, with a closed door at its end."A big gold pushable button is on the wall to the right."Behind you, a small inscription above the archway reads ""To advance, you must enter once but leave twice"".""Below it are two small illusory numbers, a one and a zero.""You reach 25x10ft room with two large pods, big enough to hold a tall humanoid."A closed door lies between both pods."You reach a 10x10ft square room with a closed door on the opposite wall, and a large silver key on the ground at its center."You reach a 25x15ft room with a closed door on the opposite wall."Above it, a large dark inscription reads: The key exists inside your veins, use the key to paint me red, but be aware of what you spurn, for what was taken shall be returned.""You enter a 25x15ft room with two large glass chambers side by side, filled with a greenish glowing transparent liquid.""A console with a single lever is in the middle of the glass vats, and each vat has a big red button with a skull on it.""This circular 10ft radius room has a large closed wooden chest at its center, and a closed door on the opposite wall.""Hundreds of animated keys are flying above you, perpetually moving in circular fashion around the room.""The square room you're on has a very high ceiling, 40ft above you, with a trapdoor on it, and no other doors.""As you stand at the center of the room, the ground beneath you starts moving, splitting into four.""Each of the platforms starts moving into the wall, revealing a deep 30ft pit with sharp spears at the bottom.""You climb through the trapdoor, and stand at the top a 50x5 straight staircase with a low ceiling.""As you start moving down, you see something at the bottom, a floating round creature with a single cyclopean eye, and many tentacles with smaller eyes at their end.""You reach a large circular 30ft radius room, with dozens of doors distributed evenly along the walls.""As you move inside the room, the doors open all at once and zombies rush from half of them, into the room.""This circular 15ft radius room has a closed door on its opposite side, a circular pit with magical darkness obscuring what is beneath it, and a large corridor around the pit, providing access to the door.""A large wooden pole stands at the center of the room, rising from the pit and nearly reaching the ceiling."You reach a large 15x15ft room with a statue on each corner of the room and a door on the opposite wall."Two statues are made of the same mineral as the pyramid, representing the sun and the moon.""The other two represent dragons, one made of silver, and another made of a green metal.""The floor has a drawn compass on it, with a big arrow pointing northwards.""This 10x10ft room has a single altar at its center with an inscription reading ""Create that which is so fragile, to utter its name would break it""."You see another gigantic human face carved on the opposite wall."Above it, a small golden plaque reads ""The word is monkey"".""This small 10x10ft room has a closed door on the opposite wall, a carved dragons head opening its jaw, and a small plaque on the left wall with an inscription reading ""Some beasts bite the hand that feeds""."The button to unlock the door is inside the dragons mouth."It can only be pressed by a living humanoid, appearing illusory to objects or other creatures.""The dragons head is an inanimate statue, and wont bite anyone, since dragons are not beasts."Pushing the button unlocks the door with an audible click."You find yourselves at the end of a very long 100x10ft corridor, with a closed door on the opposite end."This sentient door talks politely with the characters."It vanishes if the characters find a way for it to say the word ""monkey"", revealing an unlock door behind it.""It is difficult to intimidate this door, as it is invulnerable.""It knows it will temporarily vanish if it says ""monkey"", so players need creative methods.""This small 10x10ft room has a small golden button on a panel at its center, with an illusory number floating above it, and a closed door on the opposite wall.""Once you enter the room, the number starts counting the seconds down from ten."Pressing the button resets the countdown from ten seconds."This large circular 15ft radius room has a closed door on the opposite side, and a paper scroll floats in the center of the room, with a bright light shining above it."This small square room has no more doors."It contains a console filled with buttons and lever, very similar to the ones found in the other temples."This is the end of the dungeon."Around the room, there are many tables, alchemy apparatuses, ancient tomes, notes, and other dark magic paraphernalia.""Hanging by chains in the walls, there are several corpses of elves and dwarfs.""Floating on the center of the room, and facing the characters, is a Demilich.""The gate leads into a winding 5ft wide tunnel which, after many twists and turns, leads into an underground laboratory.""There are several large acid vials, glowing green, lined up in one of the walls of the laboratory.""Giant cooking pots stand over campfires, boiling and creating more acid."The room is filled with noxious fumes.This 50ft radius circular room has hundreds of eggs neatly protected in thick spider webs."Large copper tubes spread throughout the room, covering most surfaces.""Four large acid vats stand on each corner of the room, connected to a giant 30ft wide pump in the center.""The room itself is octagonal, 60ft wide, and brightly lit.""There are many alchemical tools around (most of which have been corroded beyond use), and a very wide and varied amount of vials spread through the room, mostly containing different kinds of acids and poisons."It looks like no one has walked down those steps in many years."The staircase eventually descends into a cold and dark 30ft radius circular room, with white ivory pillars around its walls.""Behind the center painting in the back wall of the laboratory, under the balcony, there is a red rune, created by the Fraz-Urb’luu.""A large dining table lays before you, plates and silverware lying upon it, with a slight green taint.""A large silver tureen is found at the center of the table, with barnacles growing on it."This cramped broom closet is covered in cobwebs.Seems like nothing has entered here in a long time."The buzzing of insects is heard as soon as the door opens, and the foul stench hits you immediately afterwards.""Jars, cans, and other containers of what once was fresh food, are now covered with insects, and contain nothing but spoiled leftovers."The doors to both these rooms are slightly open."As you open the first one, you see a table and a set of chairs in somewhat decent condition."The broken window in the room allows some of the mist to slowly float inside and disperse."As you push the door open, you see a very similar room to the one before."A sheet of parchment and some writing material now lie on top of the table."As you approach the slightly open door, a creepy piano tune is heard from within the room."The volume slowly grows louder and louder."Another relaxation room, once more mist is drifting from the broken windows to the inside of the room."The rotten smell of wood is stronger here."A rhythmic beat is heard from within the room, as well as the occasional grunt."Within the closed door lies a small room with a smelly moist bed.This small office is illuminated by a single candle on the table.Next to it lies an open book."Once you open, it slams open and a large quantity of water hits you: the room was completely flooded."What used to be cabinets filled with medicinal plants and healing items now carries a foul stench."The plants are dead and useless, and the potions turned into black sludge."A small corridor leads you to three rooms."The first two contain bunk beds, now falling apart, where the crew members once slept.""The third reveals several sleeping nets, and snoring sounds are heard from their occupants: humanoid monsters, similar to the ones that attacked you on the deck."The very air you’re breathing in this room is a poisoned fume.A slowly pulsing deep sound is heard from darkness within."A very obvious evil intent washes over you, and you feel that you’re being watched."The sound is coming from a large abomination in the center of the room."This dark green mass spreads around the ships mast, and infiltrates into the ships wooden structure.""Every second, it pulses, almost like a heartbeat.""The smell of hay is strong here, as is the smell of fur and animals.""The room has resisted the constant humidity, and is in fact warm, possibly due to the four hellish dogs that are currently sleeping in it.""Another cargo room, filled to the brink with crates, barrels, and containers.""Some of the crates are open, and all carried organic material, which has long rotted away.""Before opening the doors, you notice muffled sounds coming from within.""It seems like two people are arguing at one another, one in each room.""A set of large glowing mushrooms which will explode when disturbs them (the path is riddled with them, so unless the characters actively avoid them, they will be disturbed)."Each mushroom creates a DC 19 Fireball when disturbed (explosions won’t trigger other mushrooms).The ground has 6 small gold bricks lightly buried there.The first brick to be touched causes a DC 19 Lightning Bolt to erupt towards who picked it up.Each brick is worth 100gp.The casino is a grandiose building."Outside the entrance, dozens of Dancing Lights float around, smooth jazz is heard (played by a band of female half-elves inside the casino), and four Ogres in suits guarding the heavy-looking iron and dragonglass doors.""Inside, red carpets, crystal chandeliers, and constantly served food and drinks create a magical atmosphere, and the rooms are filled with people of all ages and races, playing games.""Vines cling to its steps, up its very high walls.""This courtyard, surrounded by a rusty and mostly broken down iron spike fence, is clearly the remains of an ancient prison."Rotten and decaying humanoid corpses fill the cell’s floor.Some parts of the tunnel have slightly collapsed over the centuries."Passage is still possible, but large clusters of rock and debris make passage difficult.""This large square area is a mostly-flat bit of desert, with seemingly random holes across it.""The tunnel is excellently constructed, clearly a creation of dwarfish masonry, and leftovers of rail tracks are seen along it."These massively overgrown parks were once properly cleaned and taken care of."Now, only wild nature, boosted by the magical powers and auras left behind, is found.""Huge trees and bushes hide a variety of dangerous jungle beasts, as well as the occasional Treant.""Glistening bath houses, spas, thermal pools, aquariums, children’s slides, artificial lakes, and other water-based relaxation activities are concentrated in this area."A magnificent coliseum looms over the surrounding buildings."White, pristine, with sharp edges, this imposing construction commands respect from all those who pass its gates.""Inside it, a large sand arena is surrounded by a 1-ft wall, around which are rows and rows of seats for spectators.""Two large areas stand, opposite to one another across the arena, for important guests, such as high ranking officials, the Emperor, or rich merchants.""Within the vessel, there is no gravity, and characters can float around (although they can only choose their direction when in contact with a surface)."The bottom of this section of the ship is exceptionally bright."The ceiling, merely 30ft high, is in fact a Wall of Light created by a Devourer lurking in this section, and currently above the fake light-ceiling.""This room is cylindrical, 50ft tall, and with a 40ft diameter.""Around the walls are 10 very large mirrors (these are actually part of the walls, and it seems like the walls gradually turn from their black opaque metal into the mirror) and a large archway (20ft wide and 30ft tall, with a black cloak covering the other side)."The characters enter a misty dark room which seems to have no limits.The only exit is the entrance through which the characters entered it."Floating directly above them, is a gargantuan Elder Brain, a physical manifestation of the leader of the Kalashticons that led that ship here.""You appear on the corner of a large square room, illuminated by torches and a floating light.""The walls, well-painted and finely built, indicate you might be inside a noble’s manor.""There are two exits out of the room, both closed with wooden interior doors, and a large round table lies in the center of the room."Sitting at the table are eight people."Lone and desolate, this eerie construction is avoided by beasts and other wildlife in the area.""At its center, there is a downwards spiraling staircase, leading into the darkness, and wide enough for two people to walk side by side.""This gate reads ""The Plague Zone"" in Primordial.""The corpses nearby show signs of putrefaction and rotting, as if they have been dead for a lot longer than the others.""It leads into a 40ft wide square crypt, under a permanent Darkness spell.""The crypt is eerily silent, and the door closes behind the characters without making any noise."There are six medium-sized sarcophagus and a large-sized one in the center of the room.A mahogany door lies opposite to the steel entrance door."The crypt leads into an underground very large cave, with a rough 1-mile wide circular shape."Vegetation grows in the dirt and rock ground (mostly mushrooms or other plants that grow in the dark)."There are hundreds of gravestones randomly placed in this cave, and there is no obvious path through them.""The silver door leads into a narrow corridor, which then leads into a brightly lit room.""The 100ft-side cube has a 30ft high tower near each corner, containing a door on the floor level, an internal spiraling staircase, and a trapdoor at its top."Atop each tower is a floating fist-sized crystal."The building is heavily guarded at all times, with high-ranking officers and prestige recruits there at all times.""The gray towering walls intimidate anyone passing through the gate, and the building is as imposing as it is a source of pride for residents of the neighborhood, who can boast of living in the safest area of the city.""On the opposite side of the bunker’s entrance, a small 10ft wide safe-room protected by magical adamantine doors acts as a final safety measure, where the royal family can barricade themselves in.""To the west, the Dining Hall, where a large party is held day and night, without stopping.""Where a massive dining table once stood, now hundreds of undead dance in rotten formal garments to the sound of cheery jazz music.""To the east, the Servant’s Quarters."This includes the Kitchen and the Guard Room."The kitchen has a few Zombies there dressed in servant’s outfits, and one is wearing a chef’s hat.""To the north, the Main Hall, which spans across both floors.""It is under an indoors permanent Control Weather spell, making the temperature within the room arctic cold."The walls are covered in arcane runes and magic circles.The western laboratory is Ur’s Arcane Research laboratory."Thousands of books line the walls, with large tables and magical apparatuses spread across the center of the room.""Several Dancing Lights fly and dance across the room, providing light on whatever anyone in the room is looking at.""Floating astrolabes, globes, quills, books, and gems also slowly hover around the room in a clock-wise motion."The eastern laboratory is Reaper’s mortuary."Several iron tables are lined against the back wall, with humanoid cadavers lying on them.""The corpses are cut open, stitched together, dismembered, bitten into, or otherwise experimented upon."The center of the room contains several steel apparatuses that resemble construct arms with sharp finesse tools at their end.The southwest spire is Ur’s chambers."It contains a pocket dimension somewhat bigger than the actual spire, mimicking the effects of a Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion.""All the furniture looks expensive, and scantily clad women serve visitors with fresh fruit and delicious wines.""One of the rooms is magically locked (requiring Ur’s blood to open), and contains dozens of magical artifacts that Ur has collected over the decades.""With modest furniture, the small tower has a washroom and a humble bedroom.""In the canopy bed, there is a corpse of a woman wearing a pink dress."The northwest spire is the astronomy lab."The ceiling is see-through from within, and an enormous telescope pointing at the stars allows one to magically bypass the storm clouds and gaze at the distant universe."The room is round and roughly forty feet in diameter.Right down the center of it are five hanging buckets.The ropes holding them extend directly into the ceiling where they meld into the stone.There is a door on the far side of the room with no discernible handle."You can make out a small inscription in the stone near the door, but will need to get closer to see what it says."A wooden sign is planted firmly in the ground in front of the buckets with bold text carefully written upon it.You also see a small pile of skeletons about fifteen feet to the left of the door.They are armored and some of them hold weapons in their hands.One of them is lying on his back with arms still bound.A few feet to the left is another corpse that clearly belongs to a dwarf.It holds a pickax in its hand and the floor near the body is partially destroyed.Just to the right of the door is a skeleton clutching at what was once his heart with one hand.The other hand is laying on top of a strange wooden chest and is tightly grasping something you can’t make out from this distance.Further right is a set of clay pots with some silver scattered on the floor in front of them.Just beyond the pots is a basin made of smoothed stone.The room is lit with electric torches and just behind the family is a switch with a lever beneath it that reads: Start Simulation.When the lever is flipped the golem will spring to life and begin walking straight towards the dwarven family who throw their hands in the air and scream through a small speaker.A projector kicks on and shows the image of a dragon on the ceiling that circles the dwarves.There is another doorway off to the side that reads Observation Chambers.This is simply a narrow hallway that spans the entire edge of the room and allows vision of all of the obstacles without risk of being harmed.The room has two shelves that are covered from floor to ceiling in wine bottles.There is a closed door on the opposite side of the room.There are a few baskets overflowing with grapes and a table in the center of the room surrounded by six chairs.On top of one of these desks are the tools needed to bottle wine.The door at the top of the stairs is not locked and will open with ease once the trap has been triggered.On the other side of the door is the interior of Jonathan's house.On the wall next to the door they see a small lever behind a flower pot that is flipped up."Off to the sides of these corridors are rooms filled primarily with rotting beds, ancient shrines, and long forgotten relics."It is roughly a hundred and fifty feet across on the front side and adorned with many other snake carvings."The side of the temple is just over three hundred feet long, but its entrances are far more subtle than the main entrance."In this room looms a man-like figure huddling over a large basin on the far side of the chamber.Tables cover this room and nearly all of them are cluttered with vials containing a strange yellow liquid.Some of them are cloudy while others are clear.Some include a shade of green while others have a hint of red.Dozens and dozens of snake skins scattered around the room."Some stored in chests, some decorating the walls, etc."Room with prisons cells with very thin bars.Inside one of these is a moderately sized boar and in another are six rabbits.Every few doors is a room that has decayed pillows on the floor.On the far end of the room is a giant snake carved into the wall."In some, this snake is devouring the world itself, in others a massive snake emerging from the earth, and in others still a snake eating its own tail."One of these snakes has an emerald eye that has not been scavenged."One of the rooms the players walk into has a intricate rug on the floor completely covered in various snake designs, all different colors slithering together to create massive maze."The room has some clay pots scattered around and a chest sitting on the far side of the rug that is beautifully colored with wooden snakes carved into the edges.One room is filled with intricate jars and ceramic pots."They are beautifully painted, though this has faded a bit with time.""Some contain copper coins, some contain crushed grains, but one contains a small snake that strikes out at the creature that opens it up."Off of the study is a bedroom and this is where things get strange.There is a large dresser with a mirror atop it as well as a comb crafted from rib cage."The entire room is decorated with skulls, all with their bottom jaws removed."The key opens the trap door and when the party moves to descend the smell of blood immediately fills the room.The ceiling is twelve feet tall and the room itself is roughly 40x40 ft."Piles of broken bones lay scattered around the edges of the room, nearly three feet in height in some places."In the center of the room is a metal coffin.In the center of the room is a makeshift stone sculpture of the Gol’Goroth."It is not well crafted, but the emotion that the artist was attempting to capture is clear - madness."The most notable part of this statue is two massive jet gemstones in the eye sockets for the sculpture."If the party is brave enough to take these gems, the squirrels will all turn to look at that person, but they will not attack.""The air turns foul, the room seems to darken, and violent tendencies arise."On the far side of the room is an exit roughly five feet wide and eight feet high."Immediately after they enter this tunnel, there is a solid iron door to the left and a path that disappears around the corner to the right."There is also a broom propped in the corner and scraps of cloth scattered around the room."If they continue to the edge of the platform, they see a twenty-foot drop into darkness.""Corpses of animals and human lay scattered across the floor of the room, making patches of it into difficult terrain."There is a small room with a table in the center stacked with samples of the Primordial Ooze."Amongst this are other gruesome science experiment results such as the corpses of creatures that the cultists attempted to splice, a few dead albino squirrels, and categorized skeletal remains.""Luckily, a tunnel extends to another room a bit further back.""In the second room, there are four Potions of Healing, a magical wand amongst a stack of ordinary armor and weapons, and a stash of wealth."The floor above quickly slides back into place and leaves them in darkness as the laughter of the priest rings throughout the room.The statue on the far side of the room begins to rise.Attached to this room is another that appears to be living quarters for the priests.There is a strong stench of many years of neglect.In the center is a large sculpture of a scale made of white marble.It sits upon a thirty foot wide seal on the ground that is decorated with a variety of runes.The room is lit by a series of magically enchanted torches that don’t seem to risk burning out any time soon.The room is also filled with the smell of incense that is burning at a few stations around this place of prayer.On the other side is a tunnel that extends forty feet before opening up to a medium sized room.This room is directly below the statue and the emblem on the floor."From the hall, the players can make out a massive iron structure.""It is impossible to tell what it is until the players get closer, but the room is illuminated by torchlight."It is roughly 40x40 and holds a 10ft tall iron golem in the center.Off to the side of the room is a cache of potions that are the same color as potions of healing but are in fact poison.A bit further down the hall is a finely carved stone door.This one seems to be of incredible quality and has a detailed Gith warrior carved upon it.The eyes of this Gith carving glow brightly and appear to be crafted from amber.There does not appear to be any handles on this door.There are two other Githyanki warriors in the room wearing fine armor laced with gold and short swords at their sides."The room is fairly small (roughly 6x6 squares with a 2x2 table near the back), so there is not a lot of room for maneuverability."The door to this room is made of fairly thick stone.It is different than most of the other doors they have encountered thus far which were simply made of wood."Regardless, it still opens without a huge amount of effort and reveals a rather small room.""When the players enter this room, they see simply a desk with a skull sitting on the center of it.""On the sides of the room are a few weapon racks with spears, swords, and maces upon them."There are a few unlit torches sitting in sconces around the room as well."The center of the floor has a large, finely woven rug upon it."The room itself is roughly 25ft x 25 ft."When the players get far enough in the room to step on the rug or modify it in any way, the skull upon the desk will burst into flame and a laugh will ring throughout the room as it slowly floats up into the air."There is a large glowing orb at the center of this room - roughly 4 feet in diameter.Inside is what appears to be a small lightning storm with a black shadow dancing and darting through storm clouds.There are many signs posted around that say things such as WARNING! or DANGER! and have a skull and crossbones painted upon them.Attached to the base of this orb are hundreds of cables that disappear into the floor.There is a set of double doors on the far side of the room with a sign overhead that reads: Mineral Workshop."If the players look around, they can see small cables feeding into the lights of this room."A small set of cords hang off of pylons on either side of the room with a small bit of metal at their end.On the left is a strange canvas wall and another canvas wall on the far side of the room near the door to the workshop.There is a strip in between these two that forms a makeshift hallway.Down this hallway are two massive structures made of metal."They are round, but appear to be formed from curved blades that connect to a central post (they are fans)."This large room is full of rocks of various shapes and sizes."They line the tables, some with labels and some without, some dull and ordinary while others are as bright and shining as gemstones.""There are chisels, hand-cranked drills, magnifying lenses, and vials at each mineral station.""The stations are labeled: Adamantine, Mithril, Cold Iron, Alchemical Silver, and Echoing Iron."The room will be filled with a gas that is meant to decontaminate all of the minerals in the room and the door slams shut violently."This supply room is filled with basic ores: copper, iron, coal, various types of rocks, and a few gemstones of each type.""The boxes fill most of the space, but the party can manage to fit inside.""Mostly there is just small tools, scrap metal, workbenches, pipes, conveyor belts, and other crafting items scattered all across this large room.""Wires hang in large piles, partially rusted from years of neglect."A few stones still rest upon the conveyor belts that lead to large metal boxes.Off to the side of the room is a large switch that is in a down position.An automatic slicing machine in the back of the room springs to life and swings down onto the conveyor belt while another machine crushes down on the conveyor with large hammers."A slot in the wall opens to reveal a set of four glowing orbs: Orange, Purple, Green, and White.""Next to a door on the far side of the room, a strange green and blue glyph begins to glow on the wall with a small spherical recess in its center."In the center of the room are three large vats that appear to be feeding the bubbly liquid into the tubes that scatter around the room.This room is full of dusty boxes and broken equipment."Most of it is rusted away from many centuries of neglect, but there are a few chests in the back of the room that still seem to be relatively intact."Inside of these is an adamantine morningstar and an adamantine battleaxe.This room is filled with unpowered clockwork creatures.Some of them are half taken apart with frayed wires exposed while others seem to be fully constructed.These completed entities stand eerily still and stare blankly.There are a few blackboards in this room with complex equations and designs.This large room is lined wall-to-wall with books."Most of them are tarnished and worn beyond recognition, but there are a few that are still in decent shape.""An ironwork dragon head made of gears, metal, and wires rests near where a door handle would normally be."The teeth appear razor sharp and each of them is tipped with a small ruby that makes them appear bloodied."This room contains a large bed, more books piled up, and some other half finished constructs."There are also a few schematics mounted on the wall in portraits and some other odds and ends found in any bedroom."The room is small, but not without value."There is a brick of solid gold sitting on a stand worth an easy 500 gold and a finely carved dagger sitting next to it that is decorated with small gemstones worth another 250 gold.The prize gem of this room is on the podium in the center."A black bag, perhaps two feet long, held closed by a long piece of rope woven around the top.""Upon this bag are velvet pictures of each color of dragon, firing their breath weapons into the skies.""Two of the frog statues are immediately adjacent to an opening on the far side of the room, while the other two are on the far left and right."On the far side of the room is a small stairway that leads up to narrow tunnel.This one is full of small boulders scattered all across the room but there is a doorway on the far side that is closed."It has a large pool of water in the center, but it too is full of these medium sized boulders.""As the party reaches the center of the room, they will be ambushed by a rock crab swarm.""When they emerge, they find themselves in rather small room that is dominated by a perfectly round hole in the center."This hole is filled with water that goes down until it disappears completely into darkness.It is at least a hundred feet deep.Written along the wall is a set of ancient text in the Deep Speech.A single mindflayer sits on a throne of coral at the back side of the room.There is a large door before them depicting a massive mural of a Kraken."When they press open the door, they will find themselves in a rather small room."There is clearly powerful magics at play here.In the very center of the room is an orb roughly a foot in diameter sitting atop a pedestal and locked tightly in place by a set of metal teeth.Along the walls of this large dome-shaped area are words carved deep in the stone that glow a faint blue.It is a simple door and it is set flawlessly within the stone with not a mote of dust visible."There is no handle on this door, but it opens without resistance when pressed."On the other side is a corridor of darkness with walls and ceiling made of stone.At the threshold of the doorway is a large brass ring that would be fixed through a bull's nose.The rest of the room appears to be an intricate laboratory filled with equipment and tools.
